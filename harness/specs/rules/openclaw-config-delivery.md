DeepClaw must defer runtime config planning to the bundled OpenClaw Gateway.

The Main-owned config coordinator must own the entire read-modify-write transaction. Production helpers must not write the active OpenClaw config and then notify another layer afterward.

When the Gateway is running, the coordinator prefers the runtime-shaped `config.get.config` object as the mutation baseline, applies the caller's mutator, and commits through `config.set` with the returned `hash` as `baseHash`. Source-shaped `raw` is only a compatibility fallback because its redacted secret paths may not align with OpenClaw's write-side runtime snapshot. A successful mutation must not be followed by `SIGUSR1` or a redundant DeepClaw process restart. Base-hash conflicts retry once from a new snapshot; other RPC failures fail closed instead of performing an out-of-band file write. When `config.set` itself durably writes the exact requested config and then a native code-1012 reload drops its response, the coordinator may verify that persisted commit after Gateway leaves running state and accept it without replaying or rewriting the mutation. When that loss cannot be verified and the mutator is replayed against the durable file, restore any `__OPENCLAW_REDACTED__` fields from the pre-mutator file snapshot so a redacted running-Gateway edit cannot overwrite real secrets.

Coordinator mutators are replayable transformations. They must not perform filesystem writes, SQLite writes, settings writes, lifecycle actions, or other non-idempotent external effects; preload required external inputs before entering the mutator and perform follow-up effects only after a successful commit.

Gateway WebSocket traces must replace serialized `raw` config-write payloads with a redacted marker. They must not log credentials introduced by a mutator.

When the Gateway is stopped or starting, the same coordinator mutates the resolved config file under the shared config lock. It must not start the Gateway solely to apply a config mutation.

DeepClaw may replace the Gateway process for process-launch environment or argument changes, explicit user restart, application lifecycle, health/crash recovery, or a failed config-delivery fallback. Provider, Agent, Channel, binding, skill, model, and ordinary plugin-entry config changes must not carry a blanket DeepClaw restart policy when OpenClaw can plan them.

All coordinator file fallback reads and writes must resolve the active config through `resolveOpenClawConfigPath()` so file delivery and Gateway RPC target the same config. No other production module may write that file.
