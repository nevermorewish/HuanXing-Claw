TokenDance desktop authorization provisions an API key through Authorization Code plus S256 PKCE; it does not produce a renewable OAuth token. Keep the verifier in Electron Main, use a random `127.0.0.1` loopback callback, validate the callback flow identifier, exchange the code within ten minutes, and persist only the returned key through the API-key secret path.

Use `https://deepclaw.com.cn` as the stable DeepClaw attribution URL in both OAuth `app_url` and every TokenDance model request's `X-App-URL` header. The runtime provider uses `https://tokendance.space/gateway/v1` with `openai-completions`. Do not expose the authorization code, verifier, or API key to Renderer state, URLs beyond the one-time callback code, logs, or checked-in configuration.

Only recognize the documented `TokenDance-Recovery-Action` values: `top_up_balance`, `reauthorize_api_key`, and `api_key_quota`. Main-owned validation returns this value as typed data. The pinned OpenClaw runtime may preserve a recognized response header as a non-secret marker in provider error text so Renderer can replace it with localized guidance; unknown or absent values retain normal provider error behavior. Recovery guidance must be localized in all supported locales.

TokenDance discovery is available only when the DeepClaw interface language resolves to Chinese. English, Japanese, Russian, and unsupported fallback locales must not show TokenDance in the add-provider catalog. This presentation gate must remain declarative and reactive to language changes; it must not delete, disable, or hide an already configured TokenDance account, because users still need to manage that account and receive localized recovery guidance after switching languages.

Browser OAuth flow ownership must be single-instance and generation-safe: duplicate start requests while a flow is active must not open parallel callbacks, and completion or cancellation from an obsolete flow must not clear or emit events for the current flow. A TokenDance flow must re-check both its flow identity and abort signal between asynchronous persistence stages so cancellation stops any subsequent credential, runtime-config, default-account, or success work. Main is the sole bridge for browser OAuth events to Renderer. The successful callback response must close its HTTP connection, and callback-server teardown must not wait for Chromium's keep-alive timeout before completing OAuth. TokenDance must persist its selected default account before emitting success so the Renderer's confirmation path is a cheap no-op rather than a second full OpenClaw runtime synchronization.
