When DeepClaw rewrites an explicit `models.providers.*` entry, existing model rows
must be merged by exact model ID instead of reconstructed from only `id` and
`name`.

All fields on an existing matching row are user/runtime-owned metadata and must
survive provider save, update, default-switch, and reload flows unless a task
explicitly owns that field.

New model IDs may receive deterministic capability defaults, but metadata from a
different model ID must never be copied onto them.

Provider synchronization fills missing `input` modalities on custom-provider
and agent `models.json` rows using the shared conservative inference. Explicit
input declarations, especially text-only deployments of otherwise visual model
families, remain authoritative. Do not infer context limits as a side effect.

Custom-provider model rows (`models.providers.custom-*`) must not receive an
inferred `contextWindow` or `contextTokens` from their model names. Existing
rows missing both fields remain unset. Rows that already declare either field
are user-owned and must never be modified. Compaction applies transport ceilings
to explicit values and otherwise uses the 50000-token reserve fallback.

Provider-level request settings are also preserved on rewrite. DeepClaw must not
inject a default `timeoutSeconds` into provider entries; absent values remain
absent and explicit values remain user-owned.

One narrow compatibility default is DeepClaw-owned: an Astra model under a
`custom-*` provider using `openai-completions` receives
`agents.defaults.models["provider/model"].params.extra_body.reasoning_effort =
"low"` when no reasoning effort is already configured. OpenClaw reads request
parameters from this per-model runtime map, not provider-catalog rows in
`models.providers.*.models` or per-Agent `models.json`. The exact legacy
DeepClaw-generated value at that path, `"none"`, must migrate to `"low"` because
Astra upstream no longer accepts it. Never overwrite any other explicit
reasoning-effort value, and do not apply the default or migration to other
models, protocols, or providers. Provider deletion must remove matching entries
from both default and per-Agent model catalogs so generated runtime parameters
do not leave stale models behind. When deletion empties an `agents.*.models`
map, keep an explicit empty object in the `config.set` payload: OpenClaw treats
this as a protected map and preserves its old entries when the field is omitted.
