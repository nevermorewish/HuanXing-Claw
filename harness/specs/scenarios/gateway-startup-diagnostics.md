Use this spec when DeepClaw shows the Gateway as starting/running but UI data does not refresh, memory-backed data cannot load, or Gateway RPC calls time out after a restart.

DeepClaw should prefer OpenClaw-native signals over stderr string matching:

- `system-presence` proves the core RPC router is serving requests.
- `health` provides the Gateway health snapshot; use cached `probe:false` first.
- `status` provides presence, health, stateVersion, uptime, and session defaults.
- `channels.status` is the channel capability signal.
- `doctor.memory.status` is the memory capability signal.
- `gateway.ready`, `health`, and `presence` events should update DeepClaw's main-process capability cache.

stderr is supporting evidence only. It should not be the primary source for deciding whether the Gateway is ready, blocked, or should be restarted.

WebSocket heartbeat misses show that the Gateway control plane did not answer within the observation window, but are diagnostic-only and never directly restart a process. A pong, any incoming Gateway frame, or a successful Gateway RPC is trusted liveness evidence and resets the 180 seconds deadline. At that deadline, Main runs one 5000ms `system-presence` probe. A successful probe records liveness and cancels recovery; a failed probe may request guarded restart only for a DeepClaw-owned Gateway. For an externally managed Gateway, DeepClaw may reconnect its own transport and report `external-unavailable`, but never automatically stop, shut down, or restart it. This liveness path has no workload tracking. Process exit, ordinary socket close, code 1012, and manual restart retain their existing independent lifecycle paths.

Liveness diagnostics are sanitized and include `state`, `lastAliveAt`, `deadlineAt`, `lastDeadlineProbeAt`, `lastDeadlineProbeResult`, `lastDeadlineProbeError`, `escalationReason`, and `externallyManaged`. Do not record RPC payloads, credentials, tokens, or raw transport errors.

## Failure Shape

Treat these as the same incident family until proven otherwise:

- `Gateway ready fallback triggered; probing RPC router before marking ready`
- `Gateway ready fallback RPC router probe failed: RPC timeout: system-presence`
- `[gateway-startup] ... slow=true`
- `[gateway-startup] Slow managed Gateway startup detected`
- `[gateway:rpc] doctor.memory.status failed`
- `[gateway:rpc] doctor.memory.dreamDiary failed`
- `sessions.list unavailable during gateway startup`
- Port `18789` is listening, but Gateway HTTP or WebSocket RPC does not return.

Important distinction:

- **Port ready** only means the process is listening.
- **Handshake ready** only means DeepClaw connected to the Gateway socket.
- **RPC ready** means a cheap call such as `system-presence` succeeds.

UI features that depend on Gateway runtime data must prefer RPC-ready evidence over port-ready evidence.

Capability failures are not Gateway core failures:

- `doctor.memory.status` timeout means memory capability degraded until `system-presence` also fails.
- `channels.status` timeout means channel capability degraded until `system-presence` also fails.
- memory-core cron unavailable, missing memory files, stale session keys, or provider credential errors do not trigger Gateway restart by themselves.

## Fast Triage

1. Confirm the process and ports:

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:18789 -sTCP:LISTEN || true
lsof -nP -iTCP:5173 -sTCP:LISTEN || true
```

2. Read recent DeepClaw logs:

```bash
tail -n 160 "$HOME/Library/Application Support/deepclaw/logs/deepclaw-$(date +%F).log"
```

DeepClaw-owned Gateway children enable `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_STARTUP_TRACE=1` automatically. Normal duration-bearing trace lines are normalized as informational records:

```text
[gateway-startup] stage=plugins.bootstrap durationMs=... totalMs=...
```

Stages taking at least 10 seconds are marked `slow=true`. A spawn-to-handshake duration of at least 30 seconds emits `Slow managed Gateway startup detected` with the longest observed OpenClaw stage. The existing `gateway.startup` metric also includes the compact `openclawTrace` summary. Startup trace records contain stage names and timings only; do not add environment values, config payloads, or provider secrets to these diagnostics.

3. Probe OpenClaw-native signals in this order. Redirect output for memory-related calls because successful responses may contain user data:

```bash
pnpm exec openclaw gateway call system-presence >/tmp/deepclaw-system-presence.json
pnpm exec openclaw gateway call health --params '{"probe":false}' >/tmp/deepclaw-health.json
pnpm exec openclaw gateway call status >/tmp/deepclaw-status.json
pnpm exec openclaw gateway call channels.status --params '{"probe":false}' >/tmp/deepclaw-channels-status.json
pnpm exec openclaw gateway call doctor.memory.status >/tmp/deepclaw-memory-status.json
pnpm exec openclaw gateway call doctor.memory.dreamDiary >/tmp/deepclaw-dream-diary.json
```

4. Only if port is listening and the core RPC probe (`system-presence`) times out, agree on the sampling scope, then sample the Gateway process on macOS:

```bash
sample <gateway-pid> 3 -mayDie >/tmp/deepclaw-gateway.sample.txt
```

Look for heavy main-thread stacks around `uv_fs_open`, `uv_fs_scandir`, `open`, `read`, `write`, `mkdir`, or repeated plugin/skill initialization frames. This usually means the Gateway event loop is busy with synchronous file work and cannot service RPCs yet.

## Sampling Coordination Protocol

Sampling is diagnostic work against a live local process. Coordinate it explicitly when the user is depending on the current Gateway for active work.

Before sampling, state:

- Which process will be sampled, including PID and why it is believed to be the Gateway.
- The sampling command and duration. Default to `sample <pid> 3 -mayDie`; increase duration only after explaining why.
- Expected impact. A short macOS sample is read-only and usually low impact, but it can produce a large file and may briefly add system load.
- Where the artifact will be written, usually `/tmp/deepclaw-gateway.sample.txt`.
- What will be inspected and what will not be shared verbatim.

Do not proceed without explicit user agreement when:

- Sampling a process that is not clearly the DeepClaw-owned Gateway child.
- Increasing sample duration above 5 seconds or repeating samples many times.
- Collecting process environment, open files, memory dumps, trace archives, or any artifact likely to contain secrets.
- Killing, restarting, or force-cleaning Gateway while active tasks, cron jobs, or user-visible work may be running.

Safe-by-default commands:

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:18789 -sTCP:LISTEN || true
ps -axo pid,ppid,etime,command | rg -i "openclaw-gateway|Electron|vite" | rg -v "rg -i"
sample <gateway-pid> 3 -mayDie >/tmp/deepclaw-gateway.sample.txt
```

Avoid by default:

- `env`, `/proc/<pid>/environ`, or full process command dumps that include tokens.
- Full memory dumps.
- Pasting raw `doctor.memory.*` output.
- Pasting complete sample files when only top stack signatures are needed.

When analyzing a sample, report a compact summary:

- Main-thread state: idle, synchronous fs I/O, network connect, CPU-bound JS, or unknown.
- Dominant stack signature, such as `uv_fs_open` under plugin runtime setup.
- Whether the finding points to DeepClaw-owned prelaunch cleanup, OpenClaw runtime startup cost, active user work, or inconclusive data.
- Recommended next action and whether it requires another user approval.

## Known Causes

### Stale Runtime Dependency Cache

Symptoms:

- Sample shows many synchronous `open` calls while plugin runtime setup is running.
- `~/.openclaw/plugin-runtime-deps/openclaw-*` contains symlink trees pointing at an old worktree or old `node_modules/openclaw`.
- Startup takes much longer than expected before RPC router becomes responsive.

Expected mitigation:

- `cleanupStalePluginRuntimeDeps()` runs before Gateway launch.
- It removes only immediate `openclaw-*` cache roots when symlinks inside point at an OpenClaw package path outside the current bundled package.
- It must not remove arbitrary third-party plugin caches.

### Over-Broad Plugin Allowlist

Symptoms:

- `plugins.allow` contains many provider or media plugins that are not configured or active.
- Gateway mirrors or loads more runtime plugin roots than the current user setup needs.

Expected mitigation:

- Preserve external plugins that are installed, configured in `plugins.entries`, or loaded through `plugins.load` / `plugins.load.paths`.
- Preserve configured bundled plugins, active provider plugins, and core runtime plugins such as `browser`, `acpx`, `device-pair`, and `memory-core`.
- Do not re-add optional provider-like bundled plugins such as `alibaba`, `deepgram`, `elevenlabs`, `groq`, `microsoft`, `phone-control`, `runway`, `talk-voice`, or `voyage` unless configured or active.

### Escaped Skill Symlinks

Symptoms:

- Logs repeatedly show `Skipping escaped skill path outside its configured root`.
- A managed root such as `~/.openclaw/skills` contains symlinks whose realpath points outside that root.

Expected mitigation:

- `cleanupAgentsSymlinkedSkills()` removes symlinks under OpenClaw managed skill roots whose realpath escapes the same root.
- Real directories and symlinks that stay inside the managed skills root must be preserved.
- This cleanup is safe because the hardened OpenClaw loader would reject those escaped entries anyway.

### Startup Work Competing With RPC

Symptoms:

- Gateway handshake completes, but `system-presence`, `sessions.list`, or `doctor.memory.*` times out during the first minutes.
- Logs mention cron repair, channel account checks, session lock cleanup, memory-core cron reconciliation, or active embedded/task runs.

Expected behavior:

- Do not mark Gateway fully ready from a pure timer fallback.
- The fallback must probe `system-presence` before emitting ready.
- Heartbeat misses remain observable during startup work, but only the 180 seconds no-liveness deadline followed by a failed `system-presence` probe may request guarded process recovery for a DeepClaw-owned Gateway.

### Capability Degraded But Core Alive

Symptoms:

- `system-presence`, `health`, or `status` succeeds.
- `doctor.memory.status`, `doctor.memory.dreamDiary`, or `channels.status` times out.
- stderr may mention memory-core cron unavailable, missing memory files, stale session keys, or credentials provider errors.

Expected behavior:

- Keep global Gateway state based on process, transport, and core RPC readiness.
- Mark only the relevant capability as degraded.
- Do not restart Gateway automatically.
- Let the user retry the capability probe or fix provider/channel credentials.

### Deadline Recovery Is Workload-Independent

Symptoms:

- Long-running chat, tool, cron, embedded, or task work is active while Gateway liveness is being evaluated.

Expected handling:

- The liveness deadline does not inspect or defer for active workloads. A trusted frame or successful RPC resets it; otherwise one deadline probe decides the ownership-scoped recovery path.
- Avoid triggering full Gateway restart for feature toggles when a narrower config reload or plugin RPC is available.

## Remediation Order

1. Avoid renderer-side transport workarounds. Renderer code must continue to use `host-api` / `api-client`.
2. Preserve `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`; never replace it with a skeleton on parse errors.
3. Run the startup sanitizers and cleanup hooks locally:

```bash
pnpm exec tsx -e "import { sanitizeOpenClawConfig } from './electron/utils/openclaw-auth.ts'; import { cleanupAgentsSymlinkedSkills, cleanupStalePluginRuntimeDeps } from './electron/gateway/skills-symlink-cleanup.ts'; sanitizeOpenClawConfig().then(() => { console.log(cleanupAgentsSymlinkedSkills()); console.log(cleanupStalePluginRuntimeDeps()); });"
```

4. Restart the app or Gateway and watch for the startup metric and trace summary:

```text
[metric] gateway.startup {
  "configSyncMs": ...,
  "spawnToReadyMs": ...,
  "readyToConnectMs": ...,
  "totalMs": ...,
  "openclawTrace": {
    "stageCount": ...,
    "lastStage": ...,
    "traceTotalMs": ...,
    "slowestStage": ...,
    "slowestStageMs": ...
  }
}
```

5. Confirm core RPC readiness:

```bash
pnpm exec openclaw gateway call system-presence >/tmp/deepclaw-system-presence.json
```

6. Confirm cached OpenClaw health before deeper probes:

```bash
pnpm exec openclaw gateway call health --params '{"probe":false}' >/tmp/deepclaw-health.json
pnpm exec openclaw gateway call status >/tmp/deepclaw-status.json
```

7. Only after `system-presence` succeeds, verify feature-specific RPCs such as memory doctor calls or channel probes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Gateway starts without restart loops.
- `configSyncMs` stays small relative to total startup time.
- `system-presence` succeeds after startup settles.
- `health` and `status` are captured in Gateway diagnostics when available.
- Memory doctor calls return when the memory capability is available.
- `doctor.memory.*` and `channels.status` failures degrade their capability only and do not trigger Gateway restart.
- Missed pongs remain diagnostic-only. Only 180 seconds without trusted liveness followed by a failed 5000ms `system-presence` probe can request one guarded restart for a DeepClaw-owned Gateway; externally managed Gateways are never stopped or restarted automatically.
- Logs no longer repeat stale runtime cache or escaped managed-skill symlink warnings for entries DeepClaw can safely clean.

## Required Regression Coverage

For fixes in this area, run:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint:check
pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/openclaw-auth.test.ts tests/unit/skills-symlink-cleanup.test.ts tests/unit/gateway-manager-heartbeat.test.ts tests/unit/gateway-ready-fallback.test.ts
pnpm run build:vite
```

If the change touches Gateway send/receive, generic RPC dispatch, fallback, or readiness, also run:

```bash
pnpm run comms:replay
pnpm run comms:compare
```

## Reporting Notes

When sharing findings:

- Quote log patterns and timing metrics, not full memory doctor output.
- Redact tokens, account identifiers, device IDs, and channel recipients.
- State whether the failure is port readiness, handshake readiness, or RPC readiness.
- Separate DeepClaw-owned cleanup issues from OpenClaw runtime initialization cost.
