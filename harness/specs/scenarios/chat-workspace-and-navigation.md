This scenario covers inheriting the selected conversation's effective workspace when creating a new Chat; selecting persisted recent, known-session, or newly browsed workspaces while the new Chat remains unbound; validating workspace availability before ACP load; deriving a newly visible local-session title atomically from its first prompt; replacing truncated cwd-only and matching synthetic UUID-date fallback titles with transcript prompts, including for the canonical main conversation after workspace resolution; recovering from deleted global or inherited workspace paths; marking unavailable non-default sidebar groups; permanently deleting their sessions after confirmation; removing every sidebar conversation owned by an Agent immediately after that Agent and its managed data are permanently deleted, clearing a successfully removed managed workspace from the new-chat workspace menu and persisted workspace metadata, with safe selection repair; binding workspaces through OpenClaw ACP cwd while pinning the canonical `agent:main:main` session to the default workspace when replay metadata is stale; targeting another agent without losing that agent's workspace or first prompt; restoring historical workspace context; renaming imported workspace display labels; navigating workspace-grouped sessions with busy, unread, and relative-time status; hiding native child rows as presentation-only while retaining their exact-key catalog records; drilling from a parent into ACP-listed direct children and returning to the direct ACP parent with deleted-target guards and exact non-cascading deletion; keeping each conversation's unsent composer text and textarea caret or selection isolated and restoring both when the user returns; browsing the effective workspace; previewing authorized local HTML and supported Office documents under their documented safety boundaries; and jumping among user questions from an overlay that leaves the conversation width unchanged. Latest exact-key Gateway catalog presence gates child actions and return-target availability without creating ACP lineage or titles.

Workspace file browsing keeps the store value `browser`; local HTML uses the existing `preview` tab and has no independent browser tab or toolbar. Current workspace resolution, ordering, title normalization, and file-browser behavior are documented in `harness/reference/chat-workspace-and-navigation.md`; the HTML guest contract is documented in `harness/reference/web-browser.md`; static Markdown rendering and safety requirements are documented in `harness/reference/markdown-rendering.md`; desktop compositing and interaction profiling requirements are documented in `harness/reference/electron-rendering-performance.md`.

DOCX and PPTX files are accepted as read-only inline previews only at or below the 20 MB compressed-input boundary. Scoped workspace and attachment references retain their authorized read route without naked-path fallback, while Workspace Browser retains its Host-validated absolute-path flow. PPTX visibility must preserve the single mounted PPTX viewer invariant across the kept-mounted Workspace and Preview surfaces. Workspace ownership remains in `harness/reference/chat-workspace-and-navigation.md`; the complete Office contract is `harness/reference/office-document-preview.md`.
