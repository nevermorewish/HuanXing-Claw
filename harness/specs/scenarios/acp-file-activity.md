This scenario covers per-turn file buttons and summaries, session-level Changes, replay, workspace-scoped Preview, and independently revalidated Open with actions for created or modified files from successful OpenClaw `write`, `edit`, and `apply_patch` calls. HTML Open with menus route the existing workspace target into the right-side Preview tab. In-limit DOCX/PPTX activity uses `WorkspaceFileRef` Preview under the Office safety contract. Deleted activity never exposes Preview or Open with.

The UI represents tool-declared activity, not a verified filesystem or Git diff. Detailed input grammar, aggregation, and path safety are documented in `harness/reference/openclaw-file-activity.md`; Office parsing and lifecycle constraints are in `harness/reference/office-document-preview.md`.
