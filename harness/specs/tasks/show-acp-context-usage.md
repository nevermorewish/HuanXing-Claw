title: Show ACP context usage in the chat composer
scenario: acp-chat-experience
taskType: renderer-feature
intent: Surface OpenClaw ACP usage_update values in the DeepClaw chat composer without adding a parallel Gateway history or transport path.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - When ACP supplies finite positive usage_update used and size values for the active session, the composer footer shows a compact context-usage meter with a ring and visible localized percentage immediately to the left of the gateway connection status, not inside the input box.
  - When the selected model changes, the meter replaces a stale ACP total with the effective context window returned in the updated agent snapshot.
  - Hovering or focusing the meter exposes the percentage and used-token/total-token counts.
  - Missing, malformed, or non-positive usage data renders no indicator.
  - Used-token data remains derived from the active ACP timeline metadata; model-limit corrections arrive through the existing typed agent snapshot and never through direct Renderer transport.

  - pnpm run typecheck
  - pnpm run build:vite
  - pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/chat-acp-inline-timeline.spec.ts --grep "context usage"
acceptance:
  - The meter displays a bounded 0-100 percentage based on ACP usage, substituting the active model's effective context limit only when the existing usage belongs to the previously selected model, both visually and through progressbar semantics.
  - The accessible hover/focus label includes the formatted percentage plus used and total token counts and updates after model selection.
  - Existing composer behavior remains unchanged when usage metadata is absent.
  - No new Renderer-to-Gateway communication path is added.
