title: Move Chat to ACP-native Main-owned stdio transport and Renderer reducer
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Replace the DeepClaw-specific Chat stream/history path with ACP session/load, session/prompt, session/cancel, session/update, and session/request_permission while keeping non-Chat Gateway capabilities intact.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Opening a Chat session loads history through ACP session/load replay.
  - The ACP child receives the authoritative DeepClaw Gateway token through its private process environment, so history replay does not depend on a separately resolved config token.
  - Sending a Chat prompt uses ACP session/prompt, shows an optimistic user segment, and coalesces it with the ACP user echo.
  - Thinking, tool calls, permission requests, plans, generated files, and generated images appear as inline timeline blocks in ACP event order.
  - Renderer does not call Gateway HTTP or WebSocket endpoints directly.
  - Gateway-backed models, providers, plugins, skills, doctor, workspace, settings, and media configuration continue to work.

acceptance:
  - Main starts and reuses openclaw acp through a spawn-safe CLI spec and @agentclientprotocol/sdk ClientSideConnection.
  - Main passes the Electron-store Gateway token to the local ACP child with `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`, without placing the token in CLI arguments or Renderer state.
  - Main forwards ACP SessionNotification envelopes and permission request envelopes without translating text, thinking, tools, or media into legacy Chat events.
  - Renderer reduces ACP notifications into an in-memory ordered timeline.
  - No DeepClaw ACP replay ledger, Chat history cache, or reduced timeline persistence is introduced.
  - The primary Chat page uses ACP notifications and replay as its ordinary timeline sources; bounded image-generation compatibility evidence remains allowed.
  - Inline process blocks preserve ordering between assistant message segments.
