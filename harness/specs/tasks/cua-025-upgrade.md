title: Upgrade bundled CUA to 0.25.0
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Upgrade the CUA SDK, native driver and computer-use Skill together to 0.25.0, restoring supported daemon telemetry suppression and preserving the Windows PE console fix.

  - README.ja-JP.md
expectedUserBehavior:
  - Computer Use retains its opt-in, permission UI and /computer-use name while using bundled native CUA 0.25.0.
  - Both the embedded daemon and Gateway-launched CLI disable CUA product telemetry without changing persistent or system settings.
  - The official Skill accompanying the pinned 0.25.0 release is bundled offline; managed-computer-use-skill now governs whole-directory startup replacement, including same-name user edits and extras.

  - tests/e2e/computer-use-skill.spec.ts
acceptance:
  - Pin @trycua/cua-driver and its native dependencies to the published 0.25.0 release and match the shipped CLI version.
  - Verify macOS universal and Windows x64 archive SHA256 values before extraction and preserve Windows PE subsystem console-to-GUI rewriting.
  - Real native SDK construction accepts manager-produced telemetry-disabled options without starting the daemon or requesting OS grants.
  - Keep CUA_DRIVER_RS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED false in Gateway CLI children and add the now-allowlisted override to embedded daemon options.
  - Keep physical ASAR-unpacked native SDK loading and validate the upgraded export/library layout.
  - Vendor the 0.25.0 official Skill snapshot and MIT license with exact source hashes while retaining computer-use as the only active Skill entrypoint.
  - Update DeepClaw-specific CLI guidance against the new command/session/screenshot contract, not a blind version-string replacement.
  - Follow managed-computer-use-skill for staged whole-directory replacement of any differing same-name installation, unchanged-content skip and rollback without historical installation hashes; preserve other-named Skills and settings.
  - Preserve Main-owned lifecycle, local-only CLI calls, no model-controlled permission grants, and no uncertain input replay.
  - Update four locales and three READMEs; report Windows native and rebuilt-package verification separately from synthetic tests.

# CUA 0.25.0 Upgrade

Use tag `cua-driver-rs-v0.25.0`, commit
`45d78fedcf2c7033ba33f10dd30f8af8ba31ec3f`, for driver and official Skill provenance.
The embedded telemetry allowlist fix shipped in 0.22.0 and remains in 0.25.0.
Keep the existing Gateway environment override and PE patch; upgrade the SDK
before restoring daemon overrides so native validation cannot repeat the 0.21.0
Configuration failure.

Implementation units: SDK/artifacts/runtime; official Skill and narrowly scoped
installed-bundle upgrades; product/reference docs and validation. These can be
worked independently with disjoint file ownership. This task remains the version
upgrade contract; `harness/specs/tasks/managed-computer-use-skill.md` supersedes its
known-pristine-only installation policy. Earlier validation remains historical
and does not verify that later ownership change.

No upstream moving-main fetch, runtime dependency downloads, new action wrapper,
MCP integration, platform expansion, or global/persisted telemetry mutation.
