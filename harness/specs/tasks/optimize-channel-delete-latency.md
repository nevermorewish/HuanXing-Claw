title: Make channel deletion responsive while preserving durable cleanup
type: ai-coding-task
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Remove a deleted channel or account from the Channels UI immediately after confirmation while Main completes the durable OpenClaw configuration and binding cleanup.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Confirming deletion closes the confirmation dialog and removes the target row immediately instead of blocking on Gateway/OpenClaw configuration delivery.
  - Main still durably deletes the channel configuration and associated binding.
  - A failed deletion reports an error and refreshes the file-backed channel view to restore the actual state.
  - Runtime convergence refresh remains asynchronous and does not block the delete interaction.

requiredTests:

acceptance:
  - The UI applies deletion optimistically before the host delete promise settles.
  - The host delete request remains the only mutation path; Renderer does not edit OpenClaw configuration directly.
  - Failure triggers a config-only refresh rather than leaving stale optimistic state.
  - No direct Renderer Gateway request or new transport path is added.
