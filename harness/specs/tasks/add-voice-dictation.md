id: add-voice-dictation
title: Add speech-to-text voice dictation to the chat composer
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Add Developer Mode-gated push-to-talk voice dictation that records microphone audio in the renderer, transcribes it through a user-configured OpenAI-compatible endpoint via a new Main-owned `asr` host module, and inserts the text at the chat composer cursor, with configuration under the Models page Speech-to-text tab.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - With Developer Mode enabled and speech-to-text configured, the chat composer shows a mic button; clicking it starts recording with a visible elapsed timer, clicking again stops recording and inserts the transcribed text at the composer cursor.
  - With Developer Mode disabled, the composer mic button and Models page Speech-to-text tab are hidden, and direct navigation to `/models?tab=voice` falls back to Chat models.
  - When Developer Mode is enabled but speech-to-text is not configured, clicking the mic button shows a localized guidance toast and opens the Models page Speech-to-text tab instead of recording.
  - Recording is capped at 180 seconds with automatic stop, Escape cancels and discards a recording, and the composer textarea is not editable while recording or transcribing.
  - Microphone failures, HTTP errors, empty results, and network failures surface localized error toasts without breaking composer state.
  - Models page exposes a developer-gated Speech-to-text tab supporting OpenAI, Groq, SiliconFlow, and custom OpenAI-compatible presets, with the API key stored locally and never synced to OpenClaw.
  - All user-visible voice-dictation and speech-to-text strings are localized in en, zh, ja, and ru.

acceptance:
  - The `asr` host module exposes `getConfig`, `saveConfig`, and `transcribe` through the existing typed `host:invoke` channel with no new ipcMain channel, and the renderer reaches it only through `hostApi.asr` in `src/lib/host-api.ts`.
  - ASR configuration lives in a dedicated electron-store file and the API key stays in the local provider secret store; neither is written to OpenClaw config or synced to the Gateway.
  - Transcription requests are Main-owned multipart posts to `POST {baseUrl}/audio/transcriptions` with a 30 second timeout, and HTTP statuses map to stable error codes that survive the IPC boundary.
  - Renderer audio capture converts microphone input to 16 kHz mono PCM16 WAV, enforces a 300 ms minimum and a 180 second maximum, and discards cancelled or stale recordings.
  - Transcribed text is inserted at the composer cursor without clobbering surrounding text, and composer editing stays locked during recording and transcription.
  - The composer microphone, Models page Speech-to-text tab, and direct voice-tab route are inaccessible until Developer Mode is enabled.
  - The mic button and every voice-dictation error or guidance message are localized in en, zh, ja, and ru with no hardcoded display strings.
  - macOS packaging declares `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` under `mac.extendInfo` in `electron-builder.yml` and enables `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` in both the app and inherited helper entitlements for Hardened Runtime audio capture.
  - Electron E2E coverage proves the Developer Mode gate, record-then-insert flow with mocked `asr` host actions, and unconfigured guidance path, without touching the real microphone or OS-global state.
  - README documentation in en, zh, ja, and ru directs users to enable Developer Mode, then use Models -> Speech-to-text for configuration and the composer mic button for input.

## Scope

`gateway-backend-communication` is the primary scenario because voice dictation
introduces a new Main-owned `asr` module on the existing `host:invoke` channel
and a renderer facade entry, keeping the Renderer/Main and transport authority
boundaries intact.

Design decisions are recorded in `harness/reference/voice-dictation.md`. No new
Gateway transport is introduced: the renderer never fetches the ASR endpoint
directly, and ASR configuration is local-only by design and deliberately
excluded from OpenClaw config delivery.
