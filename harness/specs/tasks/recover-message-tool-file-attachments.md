id: recover-message-tool-file-attachments
title: Recover generated files delivered by the OpenClaw message tool
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Render non-image files such as generated Excel workbooks when OpenClaw records their successful internal-UI delivery only in message-tool sourceReply media metadata.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - An Excel or other file successfully delivered to the current OpenClaw internal UI through the message tool appears as an attachment card in the matching DeepClaw turn.
  - The generated file card uses the existing Main-validated preview/open path and spreadsheet preview.
  - Failed, rejected, external-channel, malformed, or unconfirmed message-tool records do not create attachment cards.

acceptance:
  - General transcript attachment extraction accepts mediaUrl/mediaUrls only from a successful message tool result whose sourceReplySink is internal-ui and whose sourceReplyDeliveryMode is message_tool_only.
  - The extractor reads only sourceReply media metadata and does not promote paths from tool arguments, ordinary tool output, prose, failed delivery records, or external channel delivery.
  - Accepted references still pass the existing bounded URI grammar, user-turn alignment, Main attachment resolution, session/generation validation, and per-operation revalidation.
  - Duplicate sourceReply mediaUrl/mediaUrls entries produce one ordered candidate per URI.
  - Generated XLSX files render through the existing attachment card and spreadsheet-preview capability without a new transport or naked-path API.
  - Unit, Electron E2E, typecheck, harness, and communication regression checks pass.

## Scope

OpenClaw can use `message(action=send)` as the only visible-reply delivery path. A successful tool result records the delivered attachment under `details.sourceReply.mediaUrl` and `details.sourceReply.mediaUrls`, while ACP may omit a resource block and the assistant transcript may contain no `MEDIA:` directive. Treat that narrowly authenticated internal-UI delivery record as a third bounded attachment evidence form.

## Out Of Scope

- Parsing paths from `exec`, `write`, or arbitrary tool output.
- Trusting model-authored message-tool arguments before OpenClaw confirms delivery.
- Recovering external channel attachments or reconstructing ordinary assistant text from tool records.
- Changing spreadsheet rendering, file access authorization, or ACP transport.
