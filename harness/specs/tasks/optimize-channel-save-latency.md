id: optimize-channel-save-latency
title: Return promptly after durable channel saves while activation continues
type: ai-coding-task
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Reduce the time the channel configuration modal remains blocked by returning after configuration and binding commits, while plugin activation uses one Gateway lifecycle path without racing native config reloads.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Saving a plugin-backed channel that is already live in channels.status returns as soon as its configuration and scoped binding are durably committed instead of waiting for Gateway stop, startup, and readiness.
  - The Channels page immediately reloads the committed local configuration and then converges to runtime connection state after activation.
  - Changed plugin configuration uses OpenClaw's native config reload without an additional DeepClaw full restart when the channel is already in the runtime snapshot and OpenClaw peer link repair succeeds; a first-enable or re-enable that stays missing from channels.status may wait briefly and force one DeepClaw-owned restart; a failed peer link repair still schedules the guarded restart path after the config commit, and no-change retries still use that path when plugin discovery is required.
  - A config commit whose acknowledgement is lost to native reload is verified from the durable config instead of being reported as a false save failure; the comparison tolerates OpenClaw's auto-managed meta stamp and restored redaction sentinels, and an unverifiable loss replays the mutator through the file path after restoring any `__OPENCLAW_REDACTED__` fields from the pre-mutator durable snapshot.
  - A stale owned process that fails to recover from an in-process restart is terminated promptly and replaced instead of holding startup for the full cold-start retry budget.
  - Restart failures remain visible through normal Gateway status and logging rather than becoming unhandled promise rejections.

acceptance:
  - The save response exposes when plugin activation is pending.
  - A changed plugin config that is already live relies on the coordinator-owned config.set reload without a redundant full restart when peer link repair succeeds, and schedules a guarded full restart after commit when peer link repair fails.
  - A no-change plugin save starts a guarded Gateway restart only after the scoped binding commit completes.
  - A changed save of a plugin missing from channels.status may await a short activation poll and at most one DeepClaw-owned restart.
  - Immediate post-save refresh is config-only and does not issue an expensive runtime probe while Gateway is restarting.
  - No Renderer transport or direct Gateway request is added.
