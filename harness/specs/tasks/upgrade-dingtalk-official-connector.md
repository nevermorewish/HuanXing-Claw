title: Upgrade DingTalk to the official connector on OpenClaw 2026.7.1-2
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Replace community `@soimy/dingtalk` with official `@dingtalk-real-ai/dingtalk-connector@0.8.25` while keeping the DeepClaw `dingtalk` channel identity, existing credentials, and a single Stream client.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Existing DingTalk users keep `channels.dingtalk` credentials, bindings, and session keys without re-pairing; the official connector's internal `__default__` account is normalized to DeepClaw's existing `default` identity at runtime.
  - On upgrade, an already-configured DingTalk channel provisions or repairs the bundled dws CLI before Gateway launch without requiring the user to edit and resave credentials; an unauthenticated installation then exposes the workspace authorization action.
  - Channels UI still shows only `dingtalk`; `dingtalk-connector` is never a catalog type.
  - Community soimy and official connector never run at the same time on one `clientId`.
  - Chat works after save even if `dws` workspace authorization is skipped or still pending; new setups can complete optional desktop loopback OAuth from the DeepClaw channel modal.

acceptance:
  - Official connector is pinned to 0.8.25 and remapped onto plugin/channel id `dingtalk`.
  - npm metadata stays `@dingtalk-real-ai/dingtalk-connector`; Gateway RPC names `dingtalk-connector.*` stay intact.
  - Dual `channels.dingtalk` + `channels.dingtalk-connector` collapses to `dingtalk`; an imported `channels.dingtalk-connector` config with no `plugins` object is migrated before plugin recovery and receives canonical `dingtalk` activation metadata.
  - Soimy-only fields are stripped; `messageType: card` maps to `groupReplyMode: aicard`; nested `groupAllowFrom` maps to `allowFrom`; `defaultAccount` is kept.
  - Existing DeepClaw configurations preserve the community connector's open-group mention behavior, while configs imported from `dingtalk-connector` preserve the official default.
  - `plugins.allow` / `plugins.entries` keep a single `dingtalk` identity, and startup removes a leftover `extensions/dingtalk-connector` only after the canonical mirror is ready.
  - Lockfile does not retain `@soimy/dingtalk@3.6.10`.
  - New DingTalk setups offer optional dws desktop loopback OAuth after the channel config is durably saved, without exposing the client secret to Renderer.
  - Prelaunch provisioning also repairs dws for existing configured DingTalk channels, runs independently of the plugin-maintenance cache, is idempotent for the current bundled version, and never blocks basic chat when installation is unavailable.
