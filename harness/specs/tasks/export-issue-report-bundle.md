title: Export a multi-conversation issue report bundle
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Let a user open an issue-report workflow from Settings and export sanitized configuration and diagnostic logs, optionally including selected conversation transcripts.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Settings contains an always-visible Support section with an issue-report export button.
  - Activating the button opens a localized dialog that lists transcripts, sanitized OpenClaw configuration, diagnostic logs, and the manifest as bundle contents.
  - The user can select individual conversations or select all available conversations, but conversation selection is optional.
  - Export remains available when no conversations exist or none are selected.
  - Export creates a ZIP on the operating system Desktop directory containing every selected JSONL transcript, if any, a sanitized OpenClaw JSON configuration when available, logs, and a manifest.
  - After success, the dialog displays the full ZIP path and offers a Show in Folder action.
  - Stale selections with missing transcripts are skipped and reported; the diagnostics-only export still succeeds if no selected transcript is available, while an unsafe selected path fails the export.

acceptance:
  - Renderer invokes diagnostics.exportIssueReport only through src/lib/host-api.ts.
  - Main accepts an empty session-key list and resolves every available selected transcript under its matching agent sessions directory without following an escaping symlink.
  - The ZIP contains every available selected transcript, a recursively redacted OpenClaw config when present, available DeepClaw and OpenClaw log files with common credential forms redacted, and a manifest that reports stale selections.
  - Archive entry names do not expose source absolute paths.
  - Export writes a uniquely named ZIP atomically to the Desktop directory on macOS and Windows and returns its absolute path.
  - The success state visibly renders the path and can reveal it in the platform file manager.
  - Settings shows the bundle contents before export, supports individual and select-all conversation selection, and keeps export enabled with no selected or available conversations.
  - All new UI strings exist in English, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian.
docs:
  required: true
  reason: This changes the user-visible issue-report workflow and diagnostics export payload.

## Scope

- Add an issue-report entry in Settings and a dialog that previews bundle contents.
- Allow zero, one, multiple, or all available conversations to be selected.
- Send only selected session keys through the typed Host API; all file access remains in Main.
- Include selected transcripts, sanitized OpenClaw config, available application/runtime logs, and a manifest.
- Show and reveal the resulting ZIP path.

## Out Of Scope

- Uploading or transmitting the archive.
- Editing or deleting source transcripts, configuration, or logs.
- Guaranteeing removal of secrets manually pasted into conversation content or arbitrary log messages.
