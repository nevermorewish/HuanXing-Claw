title: Restrict TokenDance discovery to the Chinese UI
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Expose TokenDance as an addable provider only when the DeepClaw interface language is Chinese, without breaking already configured TokenDance accounts.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - TokenDance does not appear in the add-provider dialog when the interface language is English, Japanese, or Russian.
  - TokenDance appears in the add-provider dialog when the interface language is Chinese, including after switching languages in Settings.
  - Existing TokenDance accounts remain visible and manageable after the interface is switched away from Chinese.

requiredTests:

acceptance:
  - Provider availability metadata marks TokenDance as Chinese-interface-only and handles normalized Chinese locale variants.
  - The add-provider catalog applies the current reactive interface language when filtering provider types.
  - Non-Chinese interfaces cannot start a new TokenDance configuration through the provider dialog.
  - Existing TokenDance provider cards and runtime behavior are not removed or disabled solely because the interface language changes.
  - Renderer code adds no direct IPC or Gateway HTTP calls.
  - README translations describe the language-gated TokenDance entry consistently.
  - Focused tests, harness validation, communication replay, communication compare, typecheck, and lint pass.

## Scope

- Add declarative interface-language availability metadata to provider UI definitions.
- Mark TokenDance as available for discovery only in Chinese.
- Filter the add-provider catalog using the active interface language.
- Cover English-hidden and Chinese-visible behavior in Electron E2E tests.
- Preserve management and runtime behavior for TokenDance accounts that were configured previously.

## Out Of Scope

- Removing TokenDance from Main or shared provider registries.
- Deleting, disabling, or migrating existing TokenDance accounts when users change language.
- Changing TokenDance OAuth, validation, recovery, or runtime transport behavior.
- Removing TokenDance recovery translations needed by previously configured accounts.
