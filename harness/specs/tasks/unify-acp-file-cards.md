title: Unify ACP attachment and file-activity cards
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Share one ACP file-card and Open with interaction while adding independently validated workspace-scoped native actions for created and modified file activity.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Created and modified file-activity rows keep Preview and Changes controls and add the same Open with menu used by eligible assistant attachments.
  - HTML file activity and eligible local HTML attachments put Open in built-in Preview first; selecting it opens and activates the Preview tab.
  - Deleted file-activity rows continue to open Changes and never show Open with.
  - macOS and Windows list compatible applications; Linux and discovery failure retain reveal-only behavior.

acceptance:
  - Attachment and file-activity variants use one file-card shell and one target-aware Open with menu while retaining their distinct references and authorization models.
  - Only created and modified file activity exposes Open with; deleted activity retains only Changes behavior.
  - HTML Open with menus place the built-in Preview action first and separate it from native applications; the action opens and activates the right-side Preview tab.
  - Renderer supplies only a workspace root, relative path, and opaque selected handler id for workspace operations and never receives a canonical path or native command.
  - Main independently canonicalizes and contains the target, rejects non-files and symlink escapes, and freshly revalidates before handler discovery, selected-handler invocation, and reveal.
  - Linux performs no application discovery and offers only reveal through the same workspace-scoped action.
  - Four-locale UI, unit, Electron E2E, typecheck, lint, build, communication regression, and harness validation pass.

## Scope

This task covers the shared Renderer card/menu abstraction, workspace-scoped Host API operations, file-activity eligibility, localized behavior, safety contract updates, documentation, and regression coverage.

## Out Of Scope

- Converting tool-derived file activity into attachment evidence.
- Showing Open with for deleted, failed, unsupported, or unsafe file activity.
- Adding Linux application discovery or changing attachment preview classification.
