id: fix-supported-channel-connectivity
title: Restore supported channel configuration and plugin activation
type: ai-coding-task
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Make every DeepClaw-supported plugin channel persist schema-valid configuration and become visible to the running Gateway after save or QR login.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Discord, WhatsApp, and QQBot save account credentials under channels.<id> without schema-invalid account mirrors under plugins.entries.<id>.
  - DingTalk, WeCom, Feishu/Lark, WeChat, Discord, WhatsApp, and QQBot trigger a guarded full Gateway restart when saved while the Gateway is running.
  - A no-change retry of a plugin-backed channel still performs the restart needed to discover an already copied plugin.
  - Telegram remains on the native OpenClaw config reload path without an extra DeepClaw restart.

acceptance:
  - Plugin entries contain activation metadata only and never channel account credentials.
  - Discord, WhatsApp, and QQBot output passes the OpenClaw 2026.7.1 plugin-entry schema shape.
  - External channel plugin ids are retained in plugins.allow even when no unrelated plugin is present.
  - Trusted plugin install metadata targets OpenClaw's active state/openclaw.sqlite database.
  - Plugin-backed saves await the guarded Gateway restart path when the Gateway was running at request start.
  - No Renderer transport or direct Gateway request is added.
