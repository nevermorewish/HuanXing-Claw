title: Preserve OpenClaw ACP ledger integrity for compaction and terminal text
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Ensure OpenClaw preserves and records direct recovery compactions and all buffered terminal assistant text in its ACP event ledger without replacing complete ledger replay from transcript prose.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Automatic overflow, preflight, and timeout recovery compactions appear live and settle in place even when the original embedded AgentSession has already ended.
  - A shorter non-prefix final assistant chunk is emitted and recorded instead of being discarded by a stale character-count comparison.
  - A final assistant snapshot is reconciled against text actually emitted to Gateway, so parser-observed but undelivered text cannot suppress its missing suffix.
  - Gateway preserves the assistant buffer through lifecycle-error retry grace until terminal Chat projection flushes it, unless a real retry start first clears the prior attempt.
  - Buffered assistant text carried by an aborted terminal is recorded before the prompt settles as cancelled.
  - Reopening a conversation with a complete ACP event ledger replays that ledger without comparing or substituting transcript prose.
  - Existing persisted ledgers are not migrated or modified by this change.

acceptance:
  - Explicit context-engine compaction calls used by overflow, preflight, and timeout recovery emit one structured start and one terminal agent compaction event regardless of the context engine ownsCompaction flag; in-session AgentSession compaction lifecycle remains unchanged.
  - The direct lifecycle reuses one compactionId for start and terminal events, maps aborted work to cancelled, successful work to completed, and incomplete non-aborted work to failed.
  - Incomplete non-aborted direct, command, and session-operation compactions keep source separate from a stable reasonCode and bounded failureReason for recorded ACP projection.
  - Assistant snapshot extensions emit only their unseen suffix, identical or stale prefixes emit nothing, and shorter non-prefix chunks emit in full through the ordinary recorded ACP update path.
  - Embedded assistant finalization tracks parser-observed and successfully emitted text separately; message-end reconciliation emits any suffix absent from the latter before lifecycle terminal delivery.
  - Gateway does not clear buffered assistant text when lifecycle-error retry grace starts; terminal Chat projection flushes it before cleanup, while a subsequent lifecycle start clears the prior attempt before the retry emits text.
  - An aborted Chat terminal carrying buffered assistant text runs that text through the same recorded delta path before prompt cancellation; error-terminal prose is not projected as an ordinary assistant message.
  - Complete ledger replay does not fetch the bounded transcript, run a cross-source selector, strip injected prompt envelopes, or replace ledger events with transcript-derived events.
  - The existing bounded transcript fallback remains limited to cases where the ACP event ledger is unavailable or incomplete.
  - No runtime migration, startup repair, or direct write modifies an existing persisted ACP ledger.

## Field Evidence

For `agent:main:session-1788073441789`, the existing ACP replay ledger has
assistant chunk lengths `1`, `103`, `25`, `558`, `597`, and `629`; the durable
assistant response is a strict extension with a final `545`-character suffix.
The pinned adapter's former `fullText.length <= sentSoFar` condition therefore
discarded that final shorter non-prefix chunk deterministically. The missing
compaction came from a separate `ownsCompaction` gate around direct recovery
lifecycle publication after the AgentSession lifecycle had ended.

For `agent:main:session-1788085358142`, the durable final assistant message has
`5733` characters while its complete-marked ACP ledger contains a strict
`5619`-character prefix, leaving a `114`-character suffix unrecorded. The run
settled as aborted after overflow compaction. Gateway's aborted terminal carried
the complete buffered assistant message, but the pinned ACP bridge processed
message content only for delta and final states before cancelling the prompt.

This task repairs those producer paths for future events. It intentionally does
not rewrite the existing field ledger. DeepClaw remains an ACP consumer and does
not add a parallel transcript text projection.

For `agent:main:session-1788096137870`, the durable final assistant message has
`5144` characters while the complete-marked ACP ledger contains a strict
`5014`-character prefix, leaving a `130`-character suffix unrecorded. The model
completed successfully, but a later aborted lifecycle error reached Gateway's
terminal branch. That branch unconditionally cleared the live assistant buffer
before constructing the aborted Chat payload, so the terminal carried no
message and the ACP bridge had no suffix to record. The same producer failure
left `410` characters unrecorded for `agent:main:session-1788095494373`. Gateway
must retain the buffer for aborted lifecycle errors and let terminal projection
perform the ordinary final cleanup after it captures the complete message.

The three-layer diagnostic run for `agent:main:session-1788099602856` isolates
the same producer failure. Embedded finalization and Gateway projection both
reached `2534` characters, while the last throttled ACP snapshot and complete
ledger stopped at a strict `2082`-character prefix. A lifecycle error entered
the 15-second retry grace after the model had completed, cleared the Gateway
buffer immediately, and later produced an aborted terminal with zero text, so
the remaining `452` characters could not be flushed. Lifecycle error is
provisional during that grace: the buffer remains owned by terminal projection
unless a subsequent lifecycle start proves that a retry began, in which case
the old attempt is cleared at that start boundary.

Post-fix verification used the same two prompts in
`agent:main:session-1788100892918`. The second durable assistant response has
`3201` characters, and complete replay session
`5b41814b-59f1-43df-8310-d086e20867a5` records exactly `3201` assistant
characters after the second user event (`complete=1`, `next_seq=117`). The
session still reports `abortedLastRun=true`, so this exercises the delayed
aborted terminal path rather than bypassing it; terminal projection now flushes
the throttled tail before cleanup.

For `agent:main:session-1788102558415`, successful run
`5ac30cc6-7ba9-4d3c-8511-1e748f078f59` persisted a `2665`-character durable
assistant message, while complete replay session
`f1b08d07-92c6-4fd0-b2f6-7e4ee22ffa44` contains exactly its first `2046`
characters. Both prefixes have SHA-256
`c0b429a175924972c93f5bfcbe544fe4d3807f7bd742f50d45b7121b2f46ff9d`,
leaving one contiguous `619`-character terminal suffix absent. The selection
layer previously used one field for both the latest parsed stream snapshot and
the latest snapshot emitted to Gateway. If parsing advanced that field without
delivery, message-end finalization compared the durable final text to the
parser state and emitted nothing. The repair records successful stream
emission separately and uses that value for final snapshot reconciliation.
