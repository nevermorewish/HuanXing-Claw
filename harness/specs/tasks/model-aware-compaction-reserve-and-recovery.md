title: Apply model-aware compaction reserve and protect active compaction from Gateway recovery
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Keep OpenClaw compaction requests below the active model's usable context budget and prevent DeepClaw liveness recovery from aborting an observed in-progress compaction.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Selecting a model writes agents.defaults.compaction.reserveTokensFloor as 25% of an explicitly configured effective context window, rounded down; when the selected model has no explicit contextWindow or contextTokens, it writes the conservative 50000-token fallback instead of inferring a limit from the model name.
  - The chat context meter immediately uses the newly selected model's effective context window instead of retaining the previous model's ACP-reported limit.
  - Transport ceilings, including the 272k ChatGPT subscription limit, apply even when a configured model row advertises a larger native context window.
  - Startup configuration sync corrects stale local reserveTokensFloor values using the active default model's explicit context metadata, or resets the floor to 50000 when that metadata is absent.
  - Startup configuration sync backfills missing agents.defaults.compaction.recentTurnsPreserve and keepRecentTokens with 0 so completed turns are summarized instead of replayed verbatim after compaction, and preserves explicit user values for both fields across saves and Gateway restarts.
  - Developer Mode displays the currently applied compaction reserve-token floor and explains the explicit-context 25% policy plus its 50000-token fallback.
  - DeepClaw does not restart an owned Gateway while its stderr confirms that an OpenClaw compaction is in progress; recovery resumes after compaction ends or after the bounded compaction grace period expires.

acceptance:
  - The applied reserveTokensFloor is floor(effectiveContextWindow * 0.25) only when the selected model row explicitly provides a valid contextWindow or contextTokens; otherwise it is 50000 and never preserves an older local floor value.
  - Agent snapshots expose that same effective context window, and the composer recomputes its displayed total and percentage after a model switch even before ACP emits another usage update.
  - The applied recentTurnsPreserve and keepRecentTokens default to 0 when absent; explicit values in the local OpenClaw config are never overwritten by DeepClaw sync.
  - A zero retained-history budget summarizes every completed turn before the persisted compaction boundary is hardened to the compaction entry.
  - Rebuilding context from a zero-tail compaction checkpoint does not replay any completed pre-compaction message verbatim.
  - Missing model context metadata is never replaced by a model-name inference for compaction budgeting, and a missing or malformed model reference uses the 50000-token reserve fallback.
  - Developer Mode reads the applied OpenClaw configuration through the host API and is unavailable while Developer Mode is disabled.
  - Gateway recovery requires normal trusted-liveness recovery when no compaction is active, but defers automatic recovery while a bounded observed compaction is active.
  - Compaction end signals clear the recovery deferral; a missing end signal cannot block recovery indefinitely.
  - Renderer code uses host-api only; it does not read OpenClaw configuration directly.

## Background

OpenClaw's global compaction reserve defaults are too small for a 272k-token
model behind a slow provider. The resulting compaction can exceed the fixed
timeout. DeepClaw also owns the Gateway liveness restart policy, which must not
abort an observed compaction before OpenClaw can finish it.
