scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Add chat workspace selection while keeping OpenClaw ACP session cwd as the single source of truth for bound sessions.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - New chat sessions use the globally selected workspace until their first send.
  - Editable new chats list persisted recent and known session workspaces in the composer menu, alongside the default workspace and native folder picker.
  - First send initializes the OpenClaw ACP session with the selected cwd.
  - Existing sessions use OpenClaw ACP cwd as their read-only workspace context.
  - Historical sessions with recoverable OpenClaw cwd group under their real cwd.
  - Sessions without recoverable cwd group under the default workspace label.
  - Imported workspace display names can be renamed without changing their authoritative paths.
  - Renamed workspace labels stay synchronized between the sidebar and chat composer, while hover text exposes the path.
  - OpenClaw ACP cwd injection remains enabled, while automatic conversation titles omit its leading working-directory envelope.
  - OpenClaw UUID-date fallback titles are replaced by the transcript's first user prompt and are never persisted by an unchanged rename.
  - Renderer continues to use host-api and never calls direct IPC or Gateway HTTP.

acceptance:
  - OpenClaw ACP cwd is the authoritative session workspace when available.
  - DeepClaw only persists global workspace selection and recent workspaces.
  - The editable composer workspace menu shows deduplicated recent and known-session non-default workspaces with their custom display labels.
  - Bound session footer workspace is read-only.
  - Right workspace tree root matches effective chat workspace.
  - Sidebar groups sessions by workspace, then sorts each flat group by the shared activity timestamp without date buckets.
  - Custom workspace labels persist through Main-owned settings and never replace path identity.
  - Explicit user session labels remain unchanged even when they begin with a working-directory-looking string.
  - A UUID-date fallback matching the OpenClaw session id is not treated as an explicit or derived user-facing title.
