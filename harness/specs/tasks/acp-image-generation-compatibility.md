title: Project OpenClaw image-generation completions into ACP Chat
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Restore OpenClaw image-generation completion replies in DeepClaw ACP Chat without modifying OpenClaw by projecting trusted ACP and Gateway delivery evidence into the in-memory ACP timeline.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - ACP Chat first shows the image_generate background task start tool result.
  - After the normal thinking state ends, the composer shows a distinct image-generation indicator until the generated image or a failure reply is rendered, including after switching away from and back to the conversation; users may edit a draft while another send is prevented.
  - When OpenClaw later exposes a trusted internal-UI source reply through ACP or Gateway host events, DeepClaw preserves its exact user-facing text instead of replacing it with a generic caption.
  - When live or replayed ACP assistant content carries the completion as a `MEDIA:` line after a matching image-generation start, DeepClaw removes the raw directive and hydrates the image in that assistant message.
  - Successful replies include the hydrated image preview, while text-only generation failures remain visible as assistant replies.
  - Arbitrary local paths and generic MEDIA: prose without approved image-generation context are not rendered as images.
  - Renderer continues to use host-api/host-events and does not call Gateway HTTP directly.

  - pnpm run typecheck
  - pnpm run comms:replay
  - pnpm run comms:compare
acceptance:
  - DeepClaw records recent image_generate background task context from ACP tool output.
  - DeepClaw accepts only trusted ACP or Gateway completion evidence that matches the active ACP session and recent image-generation context.
  - Live and replayed ACP assistant `MEDIA:` completions with that context render inline in the matching assistant segment without exposing the raw directive.
  - Internal-UI sourceReply text is authoritative for both successful media replies and text-only failure replies.
  - DeepClaw hydrates previews through hostApi.media.thumbnails before rendering images.
  - Duplicate completion records do not create duplicate assistant image replies.
  - Live background image generation shows its dedicated generating label until its success or failure completion is projected, without changing the existing sending/thinking behavior.
  - Switching conversations preserves each live image-generation pending state and restores its indicator on return.
  - Previously rendered generated images remain visible while a later image-generation task is pending, including across session reloads and navigation.
  - Completion evidence received during a session reload is projected after the new load generation is active instead of being overwritten or dropped as stale.
  - Completion evidence received while the image conversation is inactive is deferred to that conversation, and a second prompt cannot be sent until the image task settles.
  - Stale preview resolution does not append to a different active session or generation.
