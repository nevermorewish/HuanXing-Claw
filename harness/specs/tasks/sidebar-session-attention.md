title: Show Gateway-authoritative sidebar session attention
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Show active and unread-completion state in sidebar session rows using the OpenClaw Gateway session catalog as the only status authority.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - A sidebar session shows a loading indicator while its exact Gateway session row is active.
  - An observed completion outside the visible Chat session shows an unread indicator until the conversation is opened.
  - The visible Chat session remains read when its active run completes, while retaining a current session on another route does not mark it read.
  - Reconnect hydration and persisted observed-busy state recover only transitions that DeepClaw can prove from Gateway session rows.

acceptance:
  - Sidebar busy and completion state comes only from exact-key OpenClaw Gateway session rows; ACP prompt state, ACP timeline events, and Gateway agent runtime events are never secondary authorities.
  - Gateway connection epochs, canonical list hydration, ordered event replay, and per-key timestamps fence stale list and event results from replacing newer state.
  - Busy replaces the relative timestamp, unread completion replaces busy, and a read conversation restores the relative timestamp.
  - Unread clears only when the user opens the conversation or that conversation is visibly mounted in Chat; retaining its key on another route does not clear it.
  - Exact-key observed-busy and unread state persists across restart without inferring unread from updatedAt or an entirely unobserved offline run.
  - Run-scoped cron keys do not drive base-row busy or unread attention until the Gateway exposes a canonically recoverable projection.

## Scope

The implementation preserves the Main-owned Gateway transport and the existing Renderer session catalog. It adds only a Gateway-derived run projection and local presentation attention state.

The durable architecture, ordering and failure semantics, current limitations, and future Gateway-unread migration are documented in `harness/reference/sidebar-session-attention.md`.

## Out Of Scope

- Modifying OpenClaw or upgrading the bundled OpenClaw dependency.
- Using ACP or Gateway agent runtime events as a second sidebar status source.
- Guessing unread completion from activity timestamps or unrecoverable run-scoped cron activity.
