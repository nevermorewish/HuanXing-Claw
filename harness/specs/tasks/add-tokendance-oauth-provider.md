expectedUserBehavior:
  - In the Chinese interface, TokenDance appears in the add-provider dialog with its official website logo and OAuth Login and API Key choices; other interface languages do not offer it for new setup.
  - OAuth opens TokenDance in the system browser, returns through a random loopback callback, displays a localized success page, exchanges the one-time code with S256 PKCE, and stores only the resulting API key in DeepClaw secret storage.
  - Successful OAuth closes the loopback HTTP connection promptly, closes the setup dialog, and shows feedback immediately while the provider list refreshes in the background, without waiting for a browser keep-alive timeout or repeating runtime default-model synchronization.
  - Deleting a provider removes its card optimistically while Main completes runtime and keychain cleanup.
  - TokenDance model and validation requests carry X-App-URL set to https://deepclaw.com.cn.
  - A TokenDance recovery response produces guidance for balance top-up, reauthorization, or periodic quota reset instead of being treated as an unclassified credential failure.

acceptance:
  - The OAuth authorization URL includes an encoded loopback callback, S256 challenge, app_url=https://deepclaw.com.cn, and key_name=DeepClaw.
  - The callback flow validates its opaque flow identifier, enforces a ten-minute timeout, supports cancellation, shows a localized success page instead of a blank callback, and sends the original verifier only to the TokenDance key exchange endpoint.
  - The exchanged API key is stored as an api_key secret even though the account auth mode records oauth_browser; the key is never written to logs, callback URLs, or renderer state.
  - In the Chinese interface, TokenDance uses the official website logo without dark-mode color inversion in the add-provider dialog; it is absent from that catalog in non-Chinese interfaces.
  - TokenDance runtime config uses https://tokendance.space/gateway/v1, openai-completions, qwen3.8-max as the default model, and X-App-URL=https://deepclaw.com.cn.
  - Manual TokenDance API keys use the same runtime attribution header.
  - Main-owned validation uses a minimal request with the configured model because TokenDance `/models` is public, reads only the documented TokenDance-Recovery-Action values, and returns the typed action for localized UI guidance.
  - The pinned OpenClaw runtime preserves documented recovery actions from failed model-response headers in its sanitized error text, and the Chat error banner replaces that marker with localized guidance.
  - OAuth success feedback and provider deletion update the UI immediately without waiting for follow-up runtime synchronization or snapshot reconciliation.
  - Browser OAuth emits each completion once, ignores duplicate start requests while a flow is active, and stale cancellation cleanup cannot clear a newer flow or continue into later persistence stages.
  - The callback response requests connection closure and callback-server teardown does not wait for Chromium's keep-alive timeout.
  - TokenDance records the account as default before emitting success, so Renderer confirmation does not trigger a second full runtime synchronization.
  - Renderer code adds no direct IPC or Gateway HTTP calls.
  - Focused tests, harness validation, communication replay, communication compare, typecheck, and lint pass.

## Background

TokenDance is a multi-model gateway. Its desktop authorization flow creates an API key rather than a renewable OAuth access token. DeepClaw therefore needs to use browser OAuth for provisioning while persisting and synchronizing the result through the existing API-key secret path.

TokenDance identifies DeepClaw with the stable App URL `https://deepclaw.com.cn`. OAuth key creation receives that value as `app_url`, while every model request explicitly sends the same value in `X-App-URL` so request attribution overrides key attribution consistently.

## Scope

- Register TokenDance in shared, Main, and Renderer provider catalogs, with add-provider discovery restricted to the Chinese interface.
- Implement random-port loopback OAuth with Authorization Code and S256 PKCE.
- Exchange the code in Electron Main and store the returned key through the provider secret service.
- Configure OpenClaw with the TokenDance OpenAI Chat Completions endpoint, `qwen3.8-max` default model, and attribution header.
- Validate TokenDance keys with a minimal configured-model request, classify documented recovery headers, and localize the resulting guidance.
- Cover provider discovery, OAuth protocol details, attribution, recovery classification, and visible add-provider controls.

## Out of scope

- Storing a TokenDance product-owner API key in the repository.
- Querying the partner profit-share pricing endpoint without an externally supplied product-owner key.
- Building an in-app payment checkout or polling payment sessions.
- Supporting TokenDance non-chat media protocols in this provider preset.
