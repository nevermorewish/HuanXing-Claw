title: Stop injecting custom-provider request timeouts
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Leave custom-provider request timeout policy to OpenClaw and user-authored provider configuration instead of injecting a DeepClaw-owned default.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - New custom providers do not receive a DeepClaw-authored timeoutSeconds value.
  - Startup synchronization does not add timeoutSeconds to existing custom providers.
  - Per-Agent models.json synchronization does not add timeoutSeconds.
  - Existing explicit timeoutSeconds values remain unchanged.

requiredTests:

acceptance:
  - Provider save and startup synchronization leave a missing timeoutSeconds absent.
  - Per-Agent provider synchronization leaves a missing timeoutSeconds absent.
  - Existing finite non-negative timeoutSeconds values are preserved.
  - No Renderer transport or Gateway heartbeat policy changes are introduced.
  - Focused tests, typecheck, harness validation, communication replay, and communication comparison pass.

## Background

DeepClaw briefly injected a per-attempt timeout into `models.providers.custom-*`
entries. Custom endpoints have different latency and retry characteristics, so
DeepClaw must not impose a single provider-level timeout. OpenClaw defaults and
explicit user configuration remain authoritative.

## Scope

- Remove the custom-provider timeout constant and all missing-value injection.
- Stop startup backfill in `openclaw.json`.
- Stop timeout injection into per-Agent `models.json`.
- Preserve timeout values already present in provider configuration.
- Remove documentation and harness rules that advertise a DeepClaw-owned default.

## Out Of Scope

- Deleting timeoutSeconds values already present in user configuration.
- Changing OpenClaw's timeout or retry behavior.
- Changing Gateway heartbeat or liveness recovery.
