title: Remove unavailable Realtime Talk voice input
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Remove DeepClaw's unavailable Realtime Talk microphone UI, transient audio pipeline, and dedicated Renderer/Main/Gateway bridge while preserving chat audio attachments, generic Gateway communication, and OpenClaw channel voice dependencies.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - DeepClaw no longer shows a microphone action, Realtime Talk model tab, listening state, live voice transcript, or Talk configuration.
  - DeepClaw no longer requests microphone permission or starts a realtime audio relay.
  - Text chat and audio-file attachments continue to work.
  - Generic Main-owned Gateway communication and OpenClaw channel voice support remain unchanged.

  - pnpm run comms:compare
acceptance:
  - No production source exposes or implements the DeepClaw Realtime Talk feature or its dedicated typed host/event contracts.
  - No Talk-specific microphone permission, locale key, model tab, transcript UI, audio capture/playback code, or test remains.
  - Chat audio attachments and OpenClaw Discord voice dependencies are retained.
  - Gateway event routing and shutdown behavior remain valid after the dedicated Talk relay path is removed.
  - The obsolete add-realtime-talk task is deleted, and surviving task specs neither require deleted Talk scenarios/rules nor prescribe restoring the feature.
  - Harness validation rejects task specs that reference missing primary or supplemental scenarios or required rules.
  - English, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese documentation no longer advertise Realtime Talk.
  - Electron E2E coverage proves developer mode no longer exposes the removed entry points.
