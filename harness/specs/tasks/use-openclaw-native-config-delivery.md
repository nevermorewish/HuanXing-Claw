title: Use OpenClaw-native config delivery and restart planning
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Make one Main-owned coordinator the only DeepClaw path for OpenClaw config mutation, using config.get and config.set while running and a file fallback before startup.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Saving providers, agents, channels, bindings, skills, or other hot-applicable OpenClaw configuration does not replace the Gateway process.
  - Every DeepClaw mutation of the active OpenClaw config goes through one coordinator-owned read-modify-write transaction.
  - A running Gateway mutation uses config.get as its baseline and config.set as its commit instead of writing the file directly.
  - Saving config while the Gateway is stopped does not start it.
  - Proxy and other process-launch environment changes still replace the running Gateway process.
  - Manual restart and health/crash recovery behavior remains available.

acceptance:
  - Electron Main owns config delivery; Renderer does not add direct Gateway transport calls.
  - A running Gateway mutation prefers the runtime-shaped config.get `config` object as its baseline, applies its mutator, and commits the serialized result with config.set and the returned hash as baseHash; source-shaped `raw` is only a compatibility fallback.
  - Successful config.set delivery does not send SIGUSR1 and does not call GatewayManager.restart.
  - The coordinator serializes mutations and retries one base-hash conflict from a fresh config.get snapshot.
  - When Gateway is stopped or starting, the same coordinator performs the mutation against the resolved file path and does not start the Gateway.
  - A non-conflict RPC mutation failure does not perform an out-of-band file write; it fails the mutation without silently diverging live and persisted config.
  - Provider deletion, OAuth completion, Agent deletion, Channel save/delete/binding, skill config, image config, and hidden self-heal writes do not carry independent blanket restart policy.
  - Deleting a custom default Channel account does not recreate its mirrored top-level credentials under a literal `default` account.
  - Channel account deletion removes matching credentials from plugin-backed account mirrors, including Agent deletion paths.
  - Gateway WebSocket traces redact serialized raw config-write payloads before logging them.
  - Proxy environment changes, manual restart, heartbeat recovery, process crash recovery, app update, and app shutdown/startup retain their lifecycle behavior.
  - No production helper outside the coordinator writes the active OpenClaw config file.
  - Coordinator file fallback uses the configured OpenClaw config path rather than a hardcoded home-directory path.
