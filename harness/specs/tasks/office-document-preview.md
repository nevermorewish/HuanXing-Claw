title: Add read-only Office document previews
scenario: chat-workspace-and-navigation
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Add Renderer-only DOCX and PPTX previews plus a viewport-filling Chat preview mode to existing authorized file surfaces without weakening scoped access or loading Office parsers in the initial chat bundle.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Authorized DOCX files at or below 20 MB render as isolated, read-only pages with non-interactive links in existing preview surfaces.
  - Authorized PPTX files at or below 20 MB render one slide at a time with localized previous and next controls, while at most one viewer is mounted in the Renderer.
  - The Chat Preview header offers a localized fullscreen toggle that fills the Renderer viewport, preserves the current target and slide position, and exits from its header control or Escape.
  - Legacy DOC and PPT files, remote attachments, and over-limit Office files retain their existing safe system-open, unsupported, or too-large behavior according to target authority.
  - Existing image, PDF, spreadsheet, HTML, Markdown, source, ACP Changes, attachment, and workspace behavior remains unchanged.

  - pnpm run harness:ci
acceptance:
  - Extension-authoritative inline preview supports exactly DOCX and PPTX among Office document formats; DOC and PPT remain system-open-only, and MIME alone never selects an OOXML parser.
  - DOCX and PPTX compressed input accepts exactly 20 MB and rejects 20 MB plus one byte before parser loading; text remains limited to 2 MB and image, PDF, and sheet previews remain limited to 50 MB.
  - Each target uses exactly one authorized binary-read route, rejects simultaneous attachment and workspace references before reading, and never retries a scoped reference through filePath; Workspace Browser retains its Host-validated absolute-path route.
  - Office bytes are parsed only in the Renderer from Uint8Array input, viewer components are React-lazy loaded, and parser imports occur only after bytes arrive.
  - DOCX renders with altChunks, comments, and tracked changes disabled in isolated generated DOM, and every rendered anchor default action is disabled.
  - At most a single mounted PPTX viewer exists in the Renderer; all renders are serialized, target resources are detached on cleanup, and public destroy is called exactly once per active instance.
  - All Office preview strings and controls have matching English, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian chat locale coverage and use project design tokens.
  - Fullscreen Preview is an application overlay rather than Electron window fullscreen; changing artifact tabs closes it, and entering or leaving it never mounts more than one PPTX viewer.
  - Focused unit, typecheck, lint, Vite build, Office Electron E2E, harness validate and run, harness CI, and synchronized README checks pass without a comms profile.

## Scope

This contract governs the complete Office preview implementation recorded in `harness/reference/office-document-preview.md` and enforced by `harness/specs/rules/office-preview-safety.md`. It extends the existing workspace/navigation scenario without adding a new communication transport or Main-process document conversion path.

## Durable Contracts

Implementation tasks must preserve `harness/specs/rules/office-preview-safety.md` together with the existing Renderer/Main, attachment, tool-derived file, localization, and documentation rules. Durable Office behavior and implementation rationale are recorded in `harness/reference/office-document-preview.md`; workspace and preview ownership remains recorded in `harness/reference/chat-workspace-and-navigation.md`.
