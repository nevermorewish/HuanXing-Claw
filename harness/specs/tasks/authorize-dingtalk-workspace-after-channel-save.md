title: Offer DingTalk workspace OAuth after channel save
type: ai-coding-task
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Let a DeepClaw user complete optional DingTalk Workspace OAuth immediately after saving a DingTalk bot, without requiring a terminal or blocking basic chat.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - After a new DingTalk bot is saved, DeepClaw checks the bundled dws authorization state and closes normally when it is already authorized.
  - When dws needs authorization, DeepClaw starts the desktop loopback OAuth flow, opens the official DingTalk authorization URL, and keeps the same modal in a waiting state without requiring terminal commands.
  - If the organization has not enabled CLI data access, the DWS browser flow must continue to its administrator-approval request page instead of terminating at a device-flow error.
  - The user may skip or cancel workspace authorization; the saved DingTalk chat connection remains available, and the configured channel exposes an action to restart workspace authorization later without resaving credentials.
  - Completing authorization closes the modal with localized success feedback and immediately replaces the configured-channel authorization reminder/action with a confirmed "Remove workspace authorization" action; expiration and CLI failures remain visible and can be retried.

acceptance:
  - Renderer starts, polls, cancels, and resets DingTalk workspace OAuth only through typed hostApi.channels methods.
  - Main starts dws with argument arrays and DWS_CLIENT_ID / DWS_CLIENT_SECRET environment variables; secrets are not returned to Renderer or written to logs.
  - The Gateway PATH exposes the extracted native `vendor/dws` or `vendor/dws.exe` executable directly, so bundled dws skills work on Windows without relying on an uncopied pnpm `dws.cmd` shim.
  - The loopback authorization URL (and a device code when emitted for compatibility) is parsed from bounded CLI output, authorization has a deadline, and closing, skipping, or quitting DeepClaw terminates the child process.
  - Workspace OAuth is optional and occurs only after DingTalk configuration has been durably saved; failure or cancellation never rolls back or marks basic chat unavailable.
  - Existing authorized dws installations do not prompt again.
  - The official connector's `__default__` runtime account is reconciled with DeepClaw's persisted `default` account without a false connection failure or redundant Gateway restart.
  - A live DingTalk Stream remains connected when the connector's optional `/contact/users/me` health probe returns 403 because the app lacks `Contact.User.Read`; the probe failure must not overwrite explicit `connected: true` runtime state.
  - All new user-facing strings have en, zh, ja, and ru translations and the flow has Electron E2E coverage.

This task references `gateway-backend-communication` because the Renderer must not spawn dws or access DingTalk OAuth endpoints directly. The Main process owns the CLI lifecycle and exposes only bounded authorization state through the host API.
