title: Recover an owned Gateway after three minutes without liveness
scenario: gateway-backend-communication
taskType: runtime-bridge
intent: Eliminate pong-only Gateway restarts while retaining bounded automatic recovery for an unavailable DeepClaw-owned Gateway.

expectedUserBehavior:
  - Missed Gateway pong frames do not automatically restart the Gateway before the three-minute liveness deadline.
  - A pong, any incoming Gateway frame, or a successful Gateway RPC resets the liveness deadline.
  - At the three-minute deadline, DeepClaw verifies the core RPC router with system-presence before restarting an owned Gateway.
  - A successful deadline probe does not reconnect or restart Gateway.
  - A failed deadline probe restarts only a Gateway process owned by DeepClaw.
  - A failed deadline probe for an external Gateway does not stop or restart it automatically.
  - Process exit, WebSocket close, explicit restart, and code-1012 reconnect behavior remain unchanged.

acceptance:
  - The only heartbeat-derived automatic restart path requires 180 seconds without a trusted liveness signal and a failed system-presence probe with a 5000ms timeout.
  - The 180-second deadline runs exactly one system-presence probe per silence generation.
  - Consecutive heartbeat misses remain diagnostic evidence and do not directly terminate a socket, process, or call GatewayManager.restart on any platform.
  - A successful deadline system-presence probe records liveness and cancels recovery without reconnecting or restarting.
  - A failed deadline probe calls the guarded restart path exactly once for an owned Gateway when auto-recovery is enabled and lifecycle state permits it.
  - Automatic recovery never calls stop, shutdown, or restart for an external Gateway; it may only reconnect DeepClaw's transport and report unavailable diagnostics.
  - A pong, any incoming message, or successful RPC before the deadline resets the silence sequence.
  - Code 1012 reload, child-process exit, explicit restart, and normal socket-close recovery do not race or duplicate deadline escalation.
  - Diagnostics include sanitized liveness recovery state and reason through the existing host API.
  - No chat, tool, cron, or workload tracking is added.

This task supersedes the current four-consecutive-misses process-restart policy. The one three-minute liveness deadline is intentional: it prevents a short missed-pong sequence from interrupting a functioning Gateway while keeping automatic recovery bounded for a DeepClaw-owned process that cannot serve its core RPC router.
