## Workspace Authority

OpenClaw's persisted ACP `cwd` is authoritative for a bound session. The global workspace is only the default for a new or not-yet-bound session. Resolution is:

1. Recoverable session `workspacePath` projected from OpenClaw ACP metadata.
2. Global workspace for a new or local unbound session.
3. `~/.openclaw/workspace` when a historical session has no recoverable cwd.

The effective workspace is shared by ACP load/prompt, the composer, sidebar grouping, the right-side workspace browser, and tool-derived file activity. A bound session is read-only in the composer and is not moved when the global selection changes. Missing or unreadable bound paths show unavailable/error state instead of silently changing roots.

DeepClaw persists global and recent workspace selections plus custom display labels through Main-owned settings APIs. On editable new or unbound chats, the composer menu shows the canonical default once, followed by deduplicated non-default workspaces from the most-recent list and known session paths, then the native folder picker. Recent entries stay first; all entries use custom display labels when available, keep the full path as hover text, and update only the global selection until first send binds the session. When Agent deletion successfully removes a DeepClaw-managed workspace, its recent entry and custom label are removed as well, and a matching global selection resets to the default workspace. Chat also validates historical recent entries that are neither selected nor referenced by an Agent or conversation and removes those confirmed unavailable, while existing or referenced unmanaged workspaces remain intact. Custom labels are keyed by canonical path and never replace path identity or ACP cwd authority. Renderer session state may mirror the bound path for UI coordination, but must not become a competing persistent session-to-path authority. Targeted `@agent` sends intentionally use the target agent workspace and remain an explicit branch. Navigation records that workspace on the target session placeholder before reactive loading; a newly targeted agent's first send creates its main ACP session and shares one load identity with the prompt so navigation cannot supersede delivery.

## First Send And Titles

First send initializes the ACP session with the selected cwd and then marks the local session as created/bound. A fresh session generated at cold start to replace hidden heartbeat history is marked as the same kind of local placeholder; it cannot appear as a normal empty session or bypass first-send creation. Gateway event and canonical-list reconciliation preserve the local `createdLocally` marker until acknowledgement, even when OpenClaw already reports the same key with the ACP bridge display name. The acknowledgement atomically restores a raced-away placeholder when necessary, clears the marker, and seeds a missing automatic sidebar title from the raw first prompt. The newly visible row therefore never falls back to the bridge client identity while transcript title hydration catches up. Existing explicit or cached labels win. ACP keeps `_meta.prefixCwd: true`; disabling cwd injection would break OpenClaw context. Automatic titles instead normalize away one leading `[Working directory: ...]` envelope and subsequent whitespace.

Normalization applies to automatic sources such as Gateway-derived title and Main transcript summary. It never changes an explicit user label, never removes a non-leading marker, and treats the exact truncated envelope form as a missing title so a better summary can replace it. This summary repair also applies to the canonical `agent:main:main` conversation after its default workspace is known; workspace hydration must not suppress title hydration. OpenClaw's synthetic `<first 8 session UUID characters> (YYYY-MM-DD)` fallback is also treated as missing only when it matches the row's full session id; Main's transcript summary then supplies the first user prompt. Opening and closing rename mode without changing the value must not persist any displayed fallback as an explicit label.

## Sidebar Navigation

Sessions are grouped by workspace, not by date bucket. The default workspace sorts first and other workspace labels use natural ordering. Within a group, activity sorts descending using:

1. Hydrated session last activity.
2. Summary `updatedAt`.
3. Timestamp parsed from the session key.
4. Zero.

Each group initially displays five sessions and loads five more at a time. Collapse and visible-count state are per workspace and in memory. Relative time and ordering use the same timestamp; actions replace the timestamp on hover or keyboard focus.

An exact canonical `agent:<agentId>:subagent:<childId>` row is hidden from sidebar presentation and visible workspace counts. This filtering is presentation-only: the row remains in the shared session catalog for exact-key status and attention, direct navigation, and unavailable-workspace cleanup. For embedded child titles only, DeepClaw removes one leading `[Subagent Context]` marker from the rendered ACP title. This is never a session-data mutation, and keys such as `agent:<agentId>:acp:<id>` are not native subagents.

Non-default workspace headers expose a rename action on hover or keyboard focus. A custom name updates both the sidebar group and the composer workspace chip; the header and chip keep the full filesystem path in their title text.

Sidebar validates distinct non-default group paths through Main. A confirmed unavailable group shows a warning badge and destructive delete action; available, unresolved, and default groups do not. One confirmation hard-deletes the group's sessions sequentially across agents. Successful sessions disappear together, failed sessions remain for retry, and workspace recents/labels are removed only after the full group succeeds.

## Sidebar Session Attention

OpenClaw Gateway session rows are the sole authority for sidebar run state. DeepClaw subscribes to `sessions.changed`, reconciles exact session keys into the existing session catalog, and uses canonical `sessions.list` snapshots for startup and reconnect recovery. ACP prompts, ACP timeline events, and Gateway agent runtime events do not provide a second status source.

The trailing row content has strict `busy > unread > timeago` precedence. A Gateway-active row shows the localized busy indicator. An observed busy-to-idle transition shows the localized unread indicator until the conversation is opened, after which the relative activity time returns.

Read state follows visible Chat integration rather than the retained current-session key. Chat marks its session visible on mount and on each session-key change, clears visibility on unmount, and treats completion for that visible session as read. Routes such as Settings may retain the current key, but completion there remains unread. The sidebar click path also marks the session read synchronously before navigating to Chat.

The versioned attention store persists only exact-key `observedBusy` and `unread` state. This allows a later idle canonical snapshot to recover completion when DeepClaw previously observed the run as busy, including across an app restart. A run that starts and finishes while DeepClaw is fully offline cannot be inferred and must not create unread state. Run-scoped cron keys also cannot drive base-row attention because the bundled Gateway does not expose a recoverable canonical relationship.

The complete projection, persistence, list/event ordering, failure recovery, and future `sessions.patch({ unread: false })` migration are documented in `harness/reference/sidebar-session-attention.md`.

## Embedded Subagent Navigation

A parent conversation presents only its direct native children returned by bounded ACP `session/list`. ACP `session/list` is the sole lineage membership and title authority. Latest exact-key Gateway catalog presence gates current child visibility and actionability plus direct-parent return-target availability. Presence does not invent lineage membership or titles. For available children, Gateway `status` and `hasActiveRun` remain the sole run-state authority, projected by the shared helper with exact-key `observedBusy` as the unknown-state fallback. A successful structured `sessions_spawn` result invalidates this family and triggers a canonical ACP refresh; its output does not directly add a child.

Selecting a child uses the existing exact session-selection and ACP-load path. The child header shows a localized marker and returns to its direct ACP parent, including when that parent is itself a subagent; it never follows browser history. Child and return actions are present only while their exact targets remain in the latest catalog and recheck that catalog when activated. If the direct parent is deleted, the selected child's marker remains but its return action disappears. If a child is deleted, it disappears from the parent's panel and a stale click is ignored.

Hidden native children are excluded from every implicit fallback candidate set, so startup, catalog repair, and deletion repair cannot select one merely because it is newest. A selected child remains valid while its exact catalog row exists, but a missing selected child is not recreated as a local placeholder. Deletion is exact and non-cascading: deleting a parent does not delete a child, deleting a parent while a child is selected leaves that child selected, and deleting the current parent chooses only a visible fallback. Workspace cleanup still includes retained hidden children even though workspace groups and counts use displayed rows only.

## Workspace Browser And Local HTML Preview

The right panel tabs are Workspace, Preview, and Changes. Workspace keeps the store tab value `browser`; authorized local HTML opens in `preview`. The Workspace tree uses `react-arborist`, includes hidden files, uses relative path as node identity, and remains read-only: no edit, drag/drop, or multi-select. Agent and path tags replace the older `Workspace - agent` header. Home is compacted to `~`, the path's final segment remains visible, and the full value is available as a title.

File icons come only from trusted bundled assets. Selecting a file preserves the existing preview behavior and backend boundary.

Local HTML Preview uses one hardened Electron guest as an implementation detail. The HTML anchor marks the Preview body while the route-stable host mounted by `MainLayout` owns the guest. There is no browser tab, empty guest entry, Home page, or address bar. Stable selectors are `html-preview-anchor`, `html-preview-host`, and `html-preview-webview`. Its file-only security and inert-link contract is documented separately in `harness/reference/web-browser.md`.

## Office Document Preview

The Workspace and Preview surfaces support read-only `.docx` and `.pptx` files; legacy `.doc` and `.ppt` files remain system-open-only. Extension is authoritative, and compressed DOCX/PPTX input is limited to 20 MB before Renderer parsing. Scoped workspace and attachment references use only their authorized Host API read route and never fall back to a naked path. Workspace Browser intentionally retains its existing Host-validated absolute-path read flow.

DOCX generated content is isolated and its links are non-interactive. PPTX renders one slide at a time, and kept-mounted artifact surfaces conditionally mount it so the shared Electron Renderer has a single mounted PPTX viewer. Cleanup releases DeepClaw-owned resources and invokes public `destroy()` exactly once, while the reviewed dependency-owned retained-resource limitation remains accepted. Exact security and lifecycle requirements are in `harness/specs/rules/office-preview-safety.md`; dependency choices, rendering decisions, user-visible limitations, and future hardening are in `harness/reference/office-document-preview.md`.

## Question Navigation

The Chat question directory belongs to the active ACP timeline rather than workspace persistence. Its current behavior is documented in `harness/reference/acp-chat.md`.

## Validation Anchors

This reference consolidates the former workspace sidebar, chat workspace context, sidebar workspace UI, and ACP working-directory title designs. The later flat activity-sorted sidebar supersedes the earlier recency buckets.
