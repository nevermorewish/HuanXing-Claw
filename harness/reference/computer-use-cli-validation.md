# Computer Use CLI Validation

## Current 0.25.0 Contract and Gaps

The current upgrade is `harness/specs/tasks/cua-025-upgrade.md`: SDK, native
driver, and official Skill 0.25.0, tag `cua-driver-rs-v0.25.0`, commit
`45d78fedcf2c7033ba33f10dd30f8af8ba31ec3f`. The 0.21.0 observations below are
historical, superseded-version evidence, not 0.25.0 test results.

The installation ownership contract is now
`harness/specs/tasks/managed-computer-use-skill.md`: DeepClaw replaces any differing
same-name `computer-use` directory at startup with the current bundle, including
local edits and extra files/directories, and skips matching content. It compares
current paths/content without historical installation hashes, retains staged
publication/rollback, and replaces a target symlink without following or deleting
its external referent. Other-named Skills and settings remain unchanged; custom
variants must use another name. Official 0.25.0 bytes and provenance/license
verification remain unchanged. The updated four-locale E2E covers edited-bundle
restoration, extra removal, custom-Skill preservation and default-off selection in
isolated homes. After this ownership change, `pnpm test` passed 204 suites with
2399 passing tests and three skipped; the focused installer suite passed 25 tests.
`pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/computer-use-skill.spec.ts` passed all four
locale cases plus two dependency tests. Typecheck, targeted lint, Vite build,
task validation/dry-run and comms replay/compare passed. Failure coverage includes
retaining the saved dangling/relative symlink when publication and rollback both
fail. These checks ran on macOS; Windows filesystem behavior was not rerun here.

Static inspection of that fixed source confirms:

- `cua-driver-sdk/src/embedded.rs` allows `CUA_DRIVER_RS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` and
  `CUA_TELEMETRY_ENABLED`. This allowlist change shipped in 0.22.0. DeepClaw now
  supplies `CUA_DRIVER_RS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` to both Main daemon options and
  macOS/Windows Gateway CLI children, without global or persisted mutations.
- `cua-driver/src/telemetry.rs::os_version` still invokes `cmd /c ver` on Windows
  without a no-window flag. Retain both telemetry suppression and the existing
  console-to-GUI PE patch; 0.25.0 is not an automatic upstream no-window fix.
- `cli.rs::run_call` uses `cli-explicit` for nonempty, non-default session labels
  and only sends disposable `session_end` for anonymous calls. The official
  Skill's broader disposable-CLI wording does not describe this entire path.
  This is source evidence, not a new live session-continuity test.
- The same dispatch still extracts image blocks for CLI `--screenshot-out-file`
  and can log write errors without failing the command. Prefer state-call JSON
  `screenshot_out_file`, check the actual result and fresh file, then use `read`.
  Neither zero exit nor the official Skill's "equivalent" wording proves success.

## Historical 0.25.0 Upgrade Results

The integrated version upgrade was verified on macOS arm64 before the managed
Skill ownership change. These outcomes are retained as historical evidence,
including tests of the now-superseded user-content preservation policy:

- `pnpm run lint:check` passed with seven existing React fast-refresh warnings.
- `pnpm run typecheck` passed for Main and Renderer.
- `pnpm test`: 201 suites passed; 2392 tests passed and three skipped. This includes
  the real native constructor accepting manager-produced telemetry-disabled
  options, synthetic OpenClaw exec/read/provider payload coverage, and old-bundle
  upgrade/preservation/failure tests. Before upgrading, the corresponding native
  check reproduced 0.21.0's Configuration rejection.
- `pnpm run build:vite` passed. Existing chunk-size, mixed-import and Browserslist
  warnings remain.
- `pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/computer-use.spec.ts tests/e2e/computer-use-skill.spec.ts tests/e2e/developer-mode.spec.ts`:
  12 passed, including dependency specs and all four Skill locales.
- Task validation with the real diff, selected harness dry-run, `harness:ci`,
  `comms:replay`, and `comms:compare` passed.
- Published SHA256 digests matched the downloaded macOS universal and Windows
  x64 archives. Native macOS `--version` reports 0.25.0. The downloaded/patched
  Windows executable is PE32+ GUI x86-64; this metadata check is not Windows
  execution.
- Independent review found no Critical or Important issues, including the tagged
  upstream file hashes, old-bundle fixture provenance, and packaged dotfile rules.

A fresh macOS directory package was produced with:

```sh
node scripts/run-electron-builder.mjs --mac --arm64 --dir --publish never -c.directories.output=release/cua-025-validation
pnpm cua:smoke:asar release/cua-025-validation/mac-arm64/DeepClaw.app/Contents/Resources --artifact
```

Both `electron` and `embedded` imports passed in packaged Electron and loaded the
actual artifact's unpacked 0.25.0 native library. A separate Playwright-launched
copy of that full package used an isolated HOME/user-data and E2E mode. Inside its
real Main process (`app.isPackaged=true`, `process.type=browser`), the packaged SDK
accepted telemetry-disabled host options and the unstarted host was destroyed.
The package contained all twelve Skill files, including `.gitattributes`, and its
whole-bundle digest matched the then-existing installer constant. That historical
constant comparison is not part of the current installation policy. Neither probe started a native
daemon or called OS permission APIs. The builder skipped signing because no valid
Developer ID identity was available; this is a local validation artifact, not a
signed/notarized distribution release or a replacement for the installed app.

Keep these remaining checks separate from the results above:

- Actual Windows CI/native constructor execution and Intel macOS execution.
- Rebuilt daemon startup/shutdown, signed macOS permission attribution.
- Rebuilt Windows 0.25.0 no-flash behavior, stdout/stderr, PowerShell JSON/Unicode,
  waits and cancellation. The old user A/B result is not a new Windows test.
- Live 0.25.0 named sessions, AX input, browser preparation/cleanup, recording,
  model-visible screenshot delivery/resizing, and end-to-end task success.

## Historical 0.21.0 Scope

Validated on 2026-09-09 on macOS arm64, with bundled CUA Driver/SDK 0.21.0 and
OpenClaw 2026.7.1-2. The Skill remains `computer-use` and is based on the official
0.21.0 accompanying Skill, pinned in its `UPSTREAM.json`.

## Historical 0.21.0 Automated Results

- `pnpm run lint:check`: passed with seven existing React fast-refresh warnings.
- `pnpm run typecheck`: node and web passed.
- `pnpm test`: 201 files passed; 2366 tests passed, three skipped.
- `pnpm run build:vite`: Renderer, Main and preload builds passed. Existing
  chunk-size, mixed-import and Browserslist warnings remain.
- `pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/computer-use.spec.ts tests/e2e/computer-use-skill.spec.ts tests/e2e/developer-mode.spec.ts tests/e2e/chat-acp-inline-timeline.spec.ts`:
  40 passed, including configured dependency specs and all four Skill locales.
- `pnpm run harness:ci`: passed.
- `pnpm harness run --spec harness/specs/tasks/cua-driver-cli.md`: passed, including
  fast checks, all unit tests, `comms:replay`, and `comms:compare`.
- Two read-only review rounds: no unresolved Critical or Important findings.

`tests/unit/cua-cli-exec.test.ts` uses real pinned OpenClaw exec/read and its AI
provider adapter. A fake CLI connects to a test-owned socket across separate
processes, writes a synthetic PNG, and preserves semantic error output even when
the process exits zero. The adapter's serialized HTTP body is captured at a mocked
fetch boundary: image-capable read supplies image content; a screenshot path on
stdout does not. This proves neither live provider receipt nor the complete
Gateway/ACP model-driven loop. The synthetic 1x1 PNG does not test resizing.

## Historical 0.21.0 Development Host

Started with the user-requested command:

```sh
DEEPCLAW_REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9223 pnpm dev
```

Connected the Playwright Electron MCP to Renderer on port 9223. The existing
Computer Use preference was enabled and both macOS grants were already present;
no permission request or system grant change was made.

Observed:

- The management page rendered native CLI wording and the official 0.21.0 Skill
  attribution. The existing `/computer-use` picker item remained selectable; no
  chat prompt was sent during picker validation.
- Main published a v2 descriptor with an absolute bundled binary, private socket,
  driverVersion 0.21.0 and UUID generation. It published no MCP launch payload.
- Separate native CLI calls shared one explicit named session. `sessions list`
  showed one active, non-implicit CLI session; `end_session` returned `active:false`.
- `list_windows` identified only the requested DeepClaw process's windows.
- `get_window_state` wrote a valid 1568x980 PNG for the DeepClaw window and the image
  was read successfully. No other application's image was captured.
- `verify_state` for that exact window with `window.exists:true` returned
  `satisfied`, one sample, and reported 39ms. This is a single predicate result,
  not a driver throughput benchmark or proof of an input's effect.
- `check_permissions` was read-only and reported the daemon embedded under the
  DeepClaw host with both grants present. This development observation is not proof
  of signed-release TCC attribution on other machines.
- Disabling through the management page removed the descriptor and stopped the
  service. A call to the old socket failed without starting another service.
  Re-enabling restored the original preference with a new generation/socket.
- Renderer reported zero console errors during these checks.

## Historical 0.21.0 Native Input Limitation

CUA 0.21.0 reported `ax_window_unresolved` for the observed Electron window:
there were zero AXWindow matches, so the element tree was empty and background
window-input routes were refused. Window capture and the existence predicate
still worked.

One screenshot-grounded, foreground window click aimed at the harmless Refresh
button returned `effect:unverifiable`, `route:global_input`. A Renderer click
listener recorded zero clicks. The input was not replayed and is not counted as
a successful interaction.

Pinned-source inspection explains why the result is not confirmation: this
unmodified foreground window-click branch uses foreground-assisted PID event
posting, while its result adapter labels it global input. The foreground helper
does not require its AX focus wait to succeed before posting. The supplied nested
window target and screenshot coordinates match the contract; no local coordinate
or CLI-session fix was established. Desktop HID fallback was not exercised.

## Historical Internal Installation Cleanup

The development machine retained an enabled `deepclaw-cua-computer` test plugin.
With Gateway stopped, the official OpenClaw uninstall command removed its exact
config entry, installation record, and allowlist entry. The allowlist contained
other entries and remained nonempty. After Gateway restart, it was ready and the
legacy entry was absent and not allowed; the new CLI service remained running.

The uninstaller intentionally retained the path-installed source directory. Its
MCP client differed from the branch snapshot, so those files were not manually
deleted. They are no longer allowed/registered through the old managed entry.
No unrelated plugin configuration was changed. A pre-existing validation warning
for `deepclaw-openai-image-install-verify` remained outside this change's scope.

## Historical 0.21.0 Remaining Acceptance

- Packaged Windows stdout/stderr, PowerShell JSON/Unicode, wait and cancellation.
- Signed-release macOS attribution and Intel macOS native behavior.
- Native AX actions, browser/recording workflows and desktop HID fallback.
- Final model-visible resized-image coordinate mapping.
- Live model-driven completion, stop behavior and a controlled same-model latency
  comparison. No speedup percentage or universal task-success claim is made.

## Historical 0.21.0 Windows Telemetry Flash Follow-Up

The user performed an A/B/C/B control in Windows DeepClaw using the same ordinary
exec path. A pure PowerShell command did not flash. Each normal bundled
`manifest --pretty` call flashed once, before the exit code was printed. The same
calls with `CUA_DRIVER_RS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` did not flash; repeating the
normal calls restored the original symptom. These are user-reported native
results, not observations from this macOS test host.

This isolates the telemetry-enabled path. Pinned 0.21.0 source shows a CLI
completion worker building telemetry payloads with `os_major()`, whose Windows
implementation starts `cmd /c ver` without a no-window creation flag. The PE
patch applies to cua-driver.exe, not this descendant cmd.exe. The precise window
owner has not been captured with a Windows process trace; the observed timing
alone does not establish which worker created it.

The 0.21.0 workaround supplied the public telemetry-off override to the Gateway
environment inherited by exec/CLI children on macOS and Windows. It did not
override daemon telemetry, because that embedded SDK rejected the variable (see
below). This CLI-only restriction is superseded by the current 0.25.0 contract.
No upstream binary, persistent CUA setting, system environment or Skill command
is changed. The normal CUA CLI self-reexec is not claimed to disappear; disabling
telemetry prevents its telemetry worker path. Restart DeepClaw after installing the
updated build, then repeat the normal B test without setting the variable
manually. That rebuilt-Windows acceptance remains pending. Tests cover real
OpenClaw exec environment inheritance into synthetic CLI processes.

## Historical 0.21.0 Embedded SDK Configuration Regression

The initial telemetry fix also passed the variable through
`EmbeddedDriverHostOptions.environment`. The user reported daemon startup failure
at `EmbeddedCuaDriverHost.withOptions`, before spawning. A real 0.21.0 native SDK
constructor reproduced the exact error, with `error.inner.reason`:

```text
environment variable CUA_DRIVER_RS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED is not in the embedded safe allowlist
```

The 0.21.0 SDK's `validate_options` checks a fixed environment allowlist that excludes
this variable. Its daemon launch also uses `env_clear()` and `safe_environment`,
so placing the variable in Main's `process.env` would not deliver it either.
The historical fix restored the accepted empty override list and retained the
independent Gateway/CLI fix, without bypassing the SDK boundary, changing
persistent settings, or replacing the host lifecycle. The empty-list requirement
is superseded for 0.25.0; retain the failure evidence and native validation seam.

The previous mock asserted the requested name/value pair but never ran native
validation, so it falsely accepted the invalid options. The new regression test
passes the actual manager-generated options through the real native constructor
on supported macOS/Windows hosts, destroys the unstarted native host, and mocks
only subsequent daemon I/O. Before the fix it failed with the same Configuration
error as the installed app. Linux skips the native test because DeepClaw does not
ship its CUA SDK runtime there.

The Windows job in `.github/workflows/check.yml` explicitly runs that constructor
test; the Ubuntu full-unit job alone would skip it. Local validation passed 71
focused tests including the real SDK seam, typecheck, targeted lint, and comms
replay/compare. The installed app's unpacked native SDK also accepted the corrected
options in a constructor-only Node probe, with no daemon or permission request.
The updated Windows CI job and rebuilt-app startup still require their respective
hosts/builds; constructor validation is not a claim of full desktop execution.
