# OpenClaw Config Delivery

DeepClaw bundles OpenClaw 2026.7.1-2. OpenClaw owns the field-level decision between a no-op snapshot update, hot application, subsystem restart, and in-process Gateway restart.

Provider, Agent, Channel, skill, proxy, image-generation, and plugin-install helpers express config changes as mutators. One Main-owned coordinator owns selection of the authoritative baseline and the commit:

1. If Gateway is running, call `config.get` and require its runtime-shaped `config` object and `hash`. The coordinator accepts `raw` only as a compatibility fallback for older responses.
2. Clone the runtime-shaped config, apply the mutator, and call `config.set` with the serialized result and `baseHash: hash`. Using source-shaped `raw` as the preferred baseline can misalign redacted secret paths with OpenClaw's runtime-shaped restore baseline.
3. Retry one base-hash conflict from a fresh `config.get`; fail other RPC errors without writing around the running Gateway. If `config.set` durably wrote the exact requested snapshot but its response was lost when OpenClaw began a native code-1012 reload, verify that persisted snapshot after Gateway leaves running state and accept the existing commit without replaying it. If that loss cannot be verified, replay the mutator against the durable file and restore any `__OPENCLAW_REDACTED__` fields from the pre-mutator file snapshot before persisting.
4. Treat success as converged and do not send `SIGUSR1` or schedule a redundant DeepClaw process replacement.
5. If Gateway is stopped or starting, apply the same mutator to `resolveOpenClawConfigPath()` under the shared config lock and do not start the Gateway.

This is not a write-then-notify design. No provider, Agent, Channel, skill, proxy, image-generation, or plugin-install helper may write the active config independently. The coordinator prevents a locally read stale snapshot from overwriting concurrent Gateway or CLI config changes.

Gateway WebSocket tracing must redact the complete serialized `raw` payload for `config.set`, `config.patch`, and `config.apply`; key-based structural redaction cannot inspect secrets embedded inside that string.

Coordinator-backed reads follow the same authority rule: prefer the runtime-shaped `config.get.config` object while Gateway is running and use JSON5 file parsing while it is not. Compound views derive all config-backed fields from one snapshot.

OpenClaw 2026.7.1-2 keeps auth-profile SQLite snapshots in memory. After a completed auth-store write batch, DeepClaw calls `secrets.reload` once when Gateway is running. `config.set` does not replace this refresh. Agent `models.json` needs no explicit RPC because OpenClaw re-reads it when its file fingerprint changes.

Before launch, upgrade compatibility cleanup checks the canonical `state/openclaw.sqlite` update-check row. If it exists, the SQLite row is authoritative and any legacy root `update-check.json` is moved with restrictive permissions under `backups/`; otherwise the JSON remains in place for OpenClaw to import. This cleanup runs after the one-time upgrade snapshot and prevents harmless updater-bookkeeping differences from blocking Gateway readiness or triggering an ineffective doctor retry. The snapshot is removed after either the native ready event or a successful RPC-router readiness fallback, covering the race where a fast Gateway emits readiness before DeepClaw attaches its WebSocket client.

Full DeepClaw process replacement remains necessary after a successful coordinator commit when values are injected only at process creation, including proxy environment changes, or for explicit manual lifecycle and health/crash recovery. OpenClaw config categories must not be duplicated as a DeepClaw restart whitelist.
