# DeepClaw Features

This document provides the detailed version of the Features section in the README.

### Zero Configuration Barrier

Complete the entire setup from installation to your first AI conversation through an intuitive graphical interface. No terminal commands, YAML files, or environment-variable hunting are required.

### Intelligent Chat Interface

Communicate with AI agents through a modern chat experience. DeepClaw supports multiple conversation contexts and message history, with assistant replies rendered as streaming Markdown with syntax-highlighted fenced code, CJK-aware parsing, GitHub-flavored tables, and KaTeX-powered LaTeX math (`$inline$`, `$$block$$`, `\(inline\)`, and `\[block\]`). User input remains literal text. The main composer also supports direct `@agent` routing for multi-agent setups. Fenced code preserves source line breaks, soft-wraps long lines, and provides a localized copy action after streaming completes.

Skills inserted from the composer appear as `/skill-name` cards. Click a card to open the preview sidebar and read that skill's `SKILL.md`.

When an active OpenClaw ACP session reports context usage, the composer footer shows a compact meter with a ring and a visible localized percentage immediately to the left of the gateway connection status. Hover or focus it to see the used/total token counts. Used and total tokens normally come from the active ACP `usage_update`; after a model switch, the effective context window in the updated agent snapshot replaces that stale total until ACP reports fresh usage, so the limit and percentage update immediately. The meter stays hidden when usage metadata is missing or invalid.

The ordered ACP process timeline also shows context compaction. A live marker moves in place from compacting to completed, continuing, failed, or cancelled; failed markers show a localized bounded reason when OpenClaw provides one. Historical completed markers are restored in order for compaction records included in OpenClaw's bounded ACP history response. Older records outside that response are not loaded by this view, and markers never display the compaction summary. Tool-heavy turns recover from aggregate prompt pressure by trimming older tool output to the measured budget while retaining bounded representations of the newest results and their tool-call pairing.

When you target another agent with `@agent`, DeepClaw switches directly to that agent's own conversation context instead of relaying through the default agent. Agent workspaces stay separate by default, while stronger runtime isolation depends on OpenClaw sandbox settings.

The session sidebar is workspace-first: the default workspace stays at the top, other workspaces sort naturally, and each workspace can collapse or load more sessions. A session row shows a spinner while the AI is replying, a blue dot when an unseen reply finishes, and its relative activity time after the conversation is opened; hovering still reveals row actions. Imported workspaces can be renamed from their sidebar header. The custom name is reflected in the chat composer, while hovering the header still reveals the filesystem path.

When a valid workspace is selected, a new chat inherits it while remaining editable until the first send. Editable new or unbound chats expose a workspace chip in the composer. Its menu lists recent and known-session workspaces, lets you return to the default workspace, or choose another folder. If a saved workspace folder was moved or deleted, Chat pauses session creation and asks you to choose an existing folder instead of repeatedly retrying the missing path. Unavailable non-default groups are marked in the sidebar and can be removed after confirmation; this permanently deletes every session in that group. A session row is removed and navigation changes only after permanent deletion succeeds. Failed deletions leave the conversation and confirmation open for retry. Synthetic OpenClaw UUID-date fallback titles are treated as missing only when they match the session ID, then replaced with the conversation's first user prompt instead of being persisted as the session name.

Each agent can override its own `provider/model` runtime setting. Agents without overrides continue inheriting the global default model.

The Workspace and Preview tabs in Chat's right panel provide read-only previews for Markdown, `.docx`, and `.pptx` files. Markdown previews use the same syntax-highlighted, soft-wrapped, copyable fenced code, CJK-aware parsing, and KaTeX math support in static rendering mode. The Preview header can expand the selected file to the full DeepClaw viewport; use the same control or press Escape to return to the panel. Legacy `.doc` and `.ppt` files continue to open through the operating system instead of inline. DOCX pagination may differ from Microsoft Word, and PPTX previews do not support animations, transitions, or media playback. Office files larger than 20 MB are not previewed inline.

### Local HTML Preview

The Chat right panel contains Workspace, Preview, and Changes tabs. It no longer provides a general Web Browser, Home page, or address bar. Authorized local `.html` and `.htm` attachments, file activities, and Workspace files open in Preview by default. File actions let you choose the built-in Preview or a system application, and the Preview header can open the current HTML file in the system browser.

All links are non-clickable. Links rendered by DeepClaw appear as ordinary text, and links inside HTML Preview have their styling and pointer interaction removed. HTML Preview also blocks forms, script navigation, redirects, hash navigation, popups, downloads, network requests, and device permissions. It can render self-contained local HTML but cannot leave the selected document.

### Multi-Channel Management

Configure and monitor multiple AI channels simultaneously. Each channel operates independently, allowing you to run specialized agents for different tasks.

Each channel supports multiple accounts, per-account agent binding, and switching the channel default account directly from the Channels page.

For custom channel account IDs, DeepClaw enforces OpenClaw-compatible canonical IDs: `[a-z0-9_-]`, lowercase, a maximum of 64 characters, and starting with a letter or number. This prevents routing mismatches.

DeepClaw also bundles Tencent's official personal WeChat channel plugin, so you can link WeChat directly from the Channels page through an in-app QR flow.

### Cron-Based Automation

Schedule AI tasks to run automatically. Define triggers and set intervals so AI agents can work around the clock.

The Cron page lets you configure external delivery directly in the task form with separate sender-account and recipient-target selectors. For supported channels, recipient targets are discovered automatically from channel directories or known session history, so you no longer need to edit `jobs.json` by hand. The task message field supports inserting skills with the same inline `/skill` token syntax as the main chat composer, scoped to the selected agent, so scheduled prompts can trigger skills directly.

The schedule picker is split into **Recurring** and **Once** tabs. Recurring offers Hourly, Daily, Weekdays, Weekly, and Custom raw cron frequencies with inline time and weekday controls. Once runs the task a single time at a chosen date, with the weekday shown, and time. One-time tasks must be scheduled for a future moment and are automatically removed by the runtime once they finish.

### Extensible Skill System

Extend your AI agents with pre-built skills. The integrated Skills page is local-first: it scans managed and workspace skill directories and lets you enable or disable skills without depending on the Gateway. Enterprise extensions may also expose an extension-provided marketplace.

DeepClaw pre-bundles full document-processing skills (`pdf`, `xlsx`, `docx`, `pptx`), deploys them automatically to the managed skills directory (default `~/.openclaw/skills`) on startup, and enables them by default on first install.

The Skills page can display skills discovered from multiple OpenClaw sources, including the managed directory, workspace, and extra skill directories. It shows each skill's actual location so you can open the real folder directly. For bundled OpenClaw skills, community builds ship and expose only `skill-creator`; non-allowlisted bundled skills are physically trimmed in both development and packaged startup, and stale `openclaw.json` entries for removed bundled skills are pruned.

### Secure Provider Integration

Connect to multiple AI providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Z.AI / GLM, with credentials stored securely in the native system keychain. OpenAI supports both API keys and browser OAuth for Codex subscriptions.

In Developer Mode, the Image Generation tab on the Models page supports an independent OpenAI-compatible image-generation endpoint with a Base URL, API key, and model name such as `gpt-image-2`. Image generation can therefore use a dedicated `/v1/images/generations` service while chat continues using the normal OpenAI provider.

For **Custom** providers used with OpenAI-compatible gateways, you can set a custom `User-Agent` in **Settings -> AI Providers -> Edit Provider** for compatibility-sensitive endpoints.

When you edit or switch providers, DeepClaw preserves existing per-model capability metadata such as `input: ["text", "image"]`. Newly selected Custom-provider models use OpenClaw onboarding-compatible image-input inference, with unknown models defaulting to text-only.

DeepClaw preserves explicit `contextWindow` or `contextTokens` metadata on provider model rows but does not infer a missing context limit from the model name. Compaction reserves use 25% of an explicit effective context limit; without one, `reserveTokensFloor` is set to the conservative 50000-token fallback. When no compaction configuration exists, DeepClaw also seeds `agents.defaults.compaction.mode = "safeguard"`, `keepRecentTokens = 0`, `recentTurnsPreserve = 0`, and `midTurnPrecheck.enabled = true`. Startup sync backfills both history settings with `0` only when they are missing, so every completed turn is summarized instead of being replayed verbatim after compaction; explicit `keepRecentTokens`, `recentTurnsPreserve`, and `midTurnPrecheck.enabled` values are preserved across saves and Gateway restarts.

Z.AI (CN / Global) maps to OpenClaw's built-in `zai` provider (`ZAI_API_KEY`). The default model is `glm-5.3-flash`, which is image-capable and keeps the 1M context window; plain `glm-5.3` has the same window but is text-only. Use the Code Plan preset for Coding Plan endpoints (`.../api/coding/paas/v4`) or the normal API endpoints (`.../api/paas/v4`). CN and Global are mutually exclusive because they share one OpenClaw runtime key.

DeepSeek maps to OpenClaw's built-in `deepseek` provider (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`). The default model is `deepseek-flash` (DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash) and it is registered as image-capable, so you can send screenshots and pictures to a DeepSeek chat. The retired `deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` ids are treated the same way because DeepSeek still routes them to V4.1-Flash, while `deepseek-v4-pro` stays text-only.

The remaining built-in defaults also track the current million-token generation and accept images: Anthropic uses `claude-opus-5`, Google uses `gemini-3.8-flash`, Moonshot (CN / Global) uses `kimi-k3`, and OpenRouter uses `~deepseek/deepseek-flash-latest` — the `~` prefix is OpenRouter's marker for a floating "latest" alias, whose pinned equivalent is `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash`. SiliconFlow defaults to `zai-org/GLM-5.3`, which shares the 1M context window but is text-only; choose `zai-org/GLM-5.3-Flash` there if you need image input.

Anthropic and Google register explicitly in the OpenClaw runtime configuration, the same way every other built-in provider does. Saving one of those accounts therefore delivers its key and its selected model immediately, and a model id newer than the bundled runtime's own catalog still resolves.

When a compatible gateway rejects `/models` for non-authentication reasons, DeepClaw automatically falls back to a lightweight `/chat/completions` or `/responses` probe using the configured model during API-key validation. For Anthropic and Google keys, validation additionally compares the configured model against the vendor's model listing and names an unavailable model instead of saving a provider that would fail on its first turn. Compatible relays are exempt from that comparison, because their listings can advertise only part of what they serve.

### Adaptive Theming

Choose light mode, dark mode, or a system-synchronized theme. DeepClaw adapts to your preferences automatically.

### Startup Launch Control

In **Settings -> General**, enable **Launch at system startup** so DeepClaw starts automatically after login.

### Update Prompts

DeepClaw checks for new versions on startup. When an update is available, it shows an in-app prompt; downloading and installing happen only after you choose the action.
