# DeepClaw Development Guide

This document provides the detailed version of the Development section in the README.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: 22.22.3+, 24.15.0+, or 25.9.0+ within the corresponding supported major line (Node 24 LTS recommended)
- **Package Manager**: pnpm 9+ (npm is also supported)
- **Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**: Install the required system libraries before running Electron:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y libnss3 libgtk-3-0 libxss1 libxtst6 libatspi2.0-0 libnotify4 xdg-utils
  ```
  On Ubuntu 24.04+, some packages use a `t64` suffix; `apt` automatically selects the correct variant when you run the command above.

### Available Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm run init             # Install dependencies and download bundled binaries (uv, agent-browser)
pnpm dev                  # Start with hot reload (auto-prepares bundled skills if missing)

# Quality
pnpm lint                 # Run ESLint
pnpm typecheck            # TypeScript validation

# Testing
pnpm test                 # Run unit tests
pnpm run test:e2e         # Run Electron E2E smoke tests
pnpm run test:e2e:headed  # Run Electron E2E tests with a visible window
pnpm run perf:chat        # Capture synthetic Chat Renderer/Main CPU profiles
pnpm run profile:main     # Launch the built app with Main inspector on port 9229

pnpm package:linux        # Package for Linux
```

On headless Linux, Electron tests need a display service. Use `xvfb-run -a pnpm run test:e2e`.

Electron E2E functional tests use two Playwright workers by default both locally and in CI. Set `DEEPCLAW_E2E_WORKERS=<positive integer>` to tune the ordinary parallel lane for the machine. Tests that touch OS-global state use the one-worker `exclusive` project, and host performance profiles run alone afterward. New E2E tests are parallel by default; apply `E2E_EXCLUSIVE_TAG` from `tests/e2e/parallel-policy.ts` when a test uses the real clipboard or another machine-global resource.

For a focused ordinary spec that does not need the exclusive prerequisite, run `pnpm exec playwright test <spec> --project=parallel --no-deps`.

### Electron Performance Diagnostics

`pnpm run perf:chat` runs isolated synthetic ACP workloads for streaming and for rich static Markdown sidebar and scroll interaction. It writes versioned metrics plus Renderer and Main CPU profiles under the Playwright `test-results/` directory. Renderer profiles cover the production store/render path and frame pacing. The streaming Main profile measures Main-to-Renderer IPC fanout, while the interaction Main profile shows whether Main remains idle while Renderer interactions run. Neither includes the upstream OpenClaw/ACP subprocess or GPU-process paths.

Open a CPU profile in Chrome DevTools. The artifacts contain generated fixture text only and are not product telemetry. Results are hardware-dependent, so compare repeated runs on the same machine instead of applying one cross-platform absolute threshold.

For a live Renderer recording, start development with `DEEPCLAW_REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT=9223 pnpm dev` and attach Playwright or Chrome DevTools to `localhost:9223`. For a live Electron Main recording, run `pnpm run profile:main`, open `chrome://inspect`, configure `localhost:9229`, and select the Electron Main target. Leave `DEEPCLAW_GATEWAY_WS_TRACE` unset unless WebSocket tracing itself is being measured.

DeepClaw leaves Chromium hardware acceleration enabled by default so long documents, scrolling, and layout animations can use GPU compositing and rasterization. Chromium still honors the native `--disable-gpu` command-line switch as a troubleshooting fallback for a machine with a broken graphics driver.

### Communication Regression Checks

When a PR changes communication paths such as Gateway events, the ACP Chat bridge send/receive flow, channel delivery, or transport fallback, run:

```bash
pnpm run comms:replay
pnpm run comms:compare
```

The `comms-regression` CI job enforces required scenarios and threshold checks.

### Electron E2E Tests

The Playwright Electron suite launches the packaged renderer and Main process from `dist/` and `dist-electron/`, so it does not require manually running `pnpm dev` first.

`pnpm run test:e2e` automatically:

- builds the renderer and Electron bundles with `pnpm run build:vite`
- starts Electron in an isolated E2E mode with a temporary `HOME`
- uses a temporary DeepClaw `userData` directory
- runs ordinary spec files concurrently while fencing OS-global and performance tests
- skips heavy startup side effects such as Gateway auto-start, bundled skill installation, tray creation, and CLI auto-install

The first baseline specs cover:

- first-launch Setup Wizard visibility on a fresh profile
- skipping setup and navigating to the Models page inside the Electron app

Add future Electron flows under `tests/e2e/` and reuse the shared fixture in `tests/e2e/fixtures/electron.ts`. Keep tests parallel-safe by avoiding fixed writable paths, ports, native keychains, and other external shared state. Use `E2E_EXCLUSIVE_TAG` when isolation is not possible.
