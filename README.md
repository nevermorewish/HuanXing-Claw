> This DeepClaw / HuanXing-Claw fork integrates [ClawX v0.6.0](https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/ClawX/releases/tag/v0.6.0) (`c8a54dcd`). It retains multi-brand builds, account login, provider/model configuration, usage history, config management, logs, and brand-specific update feeds. Chat uses the upstream ACP implementation; Computer Use and developer-mode voice input follow upstream behavior. The old Dreams page has been removed upstream.

## Overview

**DeepClaw** bridges the gap between powerful AI agents and everyday users. Built on top of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/OpenClaw), it transforms command-line AI orchestration into an accessible, beautiful desktop experience - no terminal required.

Whether you're automating workflows, managing AI-powered channels, or scheduling intelligent tasks, DeepClaw provides the interface you need to harness AI agents effectively.

DeepClaw comes pre-configured with best-practice model providers and natively supports Windows as well as multi-language settings. Compaction reserves use 25% of an explicitly configured model context window, or a conservative 50000-token fallback when that metadata is absent; completed turns continue through the summary instead of being replayed verbatim after compaction. Developer Mode shows the applied reserve value. You can also fine-tune advanced configurations via **Settings -> Advanced -> Developer Mode**.

## Why DeepClaw

Building AI agents shouldn't require mastering the command line. DeepClaw was designed with a simple philosophy: **powerful technology deserves an interface that respects your time.** DeepClaw is built directly upon the official **OpenClaw** core. Instead of requiring a separate installation, we embed the runtime within the application for a seamless, battery-included experience. We stay closely aligned with upstream OpenClaw so you can benefit from the latest official capabilities, stability improvements, and ecosystem compatibility.

| Challenge | DeepClaw Solution |
|-----------|----------------|
| Complex CLI setup | One-click installation with a guided setup wizard |
| Configuration files | Visual settings with real-time validation |
| Process management | Automatic Gateway lifecycle management |
| App updates | Startup update checks with a prompt before downloading or installing |
| Multiple AI providers | Unified provider configuration panel |
| Skill/plugin installation | Local-first skill management with an optional extension-provided marketplace |

### Features

- **🎯 Zero Configuration Barrier**: Complete setup through an intuitive graphical interface - no terminal commands, YAML files, or environment-variable hunting.
- **💬 Intelligent Chat Interface**: Multi-session context and history, streaming Markdown with syntax highlighting, CJK-aware parsing, tables, KaTeX math, direct `@agent` routing, inline `/skill` cards, embedded subagent status with live read-only child drill-down and direct-parent return, workspace-first sessions, and read-only previews for Markdown, `.docx`, `.pptx`, and local HTML.
- **🎙️ Voice Dictation (Developer Mode)**: After enabling **Developer Mode** in Settings, dictate into the chat composer — the mic button records your voice, transcribes it through a user-configured speech-to-text service, and inserts the text at the cursor. Set it up under **Models -> Speech-to-text**: pick the API type (OpenAI Audio Transcriptions or OpenAI Chat Completions with `input_audio`) and a matching preset (OpenAI, Groq, SiliconFlow, Alibaba Cloud Model Studio, or a custom endpoint).
  - Clicking the mic checks permission. Denied access opens guidance with an explicit **Open system settings** action; restrictions may require your administrator. On macOS, enable DeepClaw under **Privacy & Security → Microphone**, then fully quit and restart it. In development, permission may belong to the launching IDE or terminal, which also needs restarting. On Windows, enable microphone access for desktop apps. Close the dialog and click the mic again to retry; recording never starts automatically.
- **🤖 Agent Lifecycle Management**: Create and manage specialized Agents from the desktop. Deleting a non-default Agent requires explicit confirmation and permanently removes its DeepClaw-managed workspace and associated chat history; its conversations and removed workspace entry disappear from Chat immediately and cannot be recovered.
- **🧰 Issue Report Export**: Open Settings > Support to review the bundle contents and create a ZIP on the desktop with sanitized OpenClaw configuration and available diagnostic logs. Conversation selection is optional; selected JSONL transcripts are included when available, and DeepClaw shows the saved path when complete.
- **📡 Multi-Channel Management**: Configure and monitor independent AI channels with multiple accounts, per-account agent binding, default-account switching, the bundled official Tencent personal WeChat channel plugin, and the official DingTalk connector remapped onto the existing `dingtalk` channel. After adding DingTalk—or upgrading an existing DingTalk configuration—DeepClaw provisions the bundled workspace CLI and offers optional DingTalk Workspace OAuth for calendar, docs, and other `dws` skills; skipping it does not affect chat, and authorization can be started or removed later from the configured channel. The organization's primary administrator must first enable member CLI data access in the DingTalk developer console.
- **⏰ Cron-Based Automation**: Define recurring or one-time schedules, insert skills into scheduled prompts, and deliver results to external channels.
- **🧩 Extensible Skill System**: Manage skills locally without depending on the Gateway, discover skills from multiple OpenClaw sources, and use bundled document-processing skills for `pdf`, `xlsx`, `docx`, and `pptx`.
- **🔐 Secure Provider Integration**: Connect OpenAI, Anthropic, Z.AI / GLM, and other providers with credentials stored in the native system keychain, alongside custom providers and compatibility fallbacks. When the interface language is Chinese, the provider catalog also offers TokenDance with browser OAuth, PKCE, and DeepClaw request attribution. In Developer Mode, configure image-generation endpoints in **Models -> Image Generation**; completed generated images render inline in Chat instead of exposing OpenClaw's raw `MEDIA:` path.
- **💻 Local Computer Use**: On macOS 13+ (Intel or Apple silicon) and Windows x64, agents use the bundled native CUA CLI for window, accessibility, menu, verification, and desktop operations. Primary-display capture and input remain available. The driver runs locally without OpenClaw node pairing or a separate runtime download.
- **🌙 Adaptive Theming**: Choose light mode, dark mode, or system-synchronized themes.
- **🚀 Startup Launch Control**: Enable **Launch at system startup** in **Settings -> General**.
- **🔔 Update Prompts**: Check for new versions at startup and choose whether to download or install them.

> For full feature details, see [docs/en-US/features.md](docs/en-US/features.md).

### Typical Use Cases

- **🤖 Personal AI Assistant**: Configure a general-purpose AI agent to answer questions, draft emails, summarize documents, and help with everyday tasks from a clean desktop interface.
- **📊 Automated Monitoring**: Schedule agents to monitor news feeds, track prices, or watch for specific events, with results delivered to your preferred notification channel.
- **💻 Developer Productivity**: Integrate AI into your development workflow for code review, documentation generation, and repetitive coding tasks.
- **🔄 Workflow Automation**: Chain multiple skills into visual automation pipelines that process data, transform content, and trigger actions.

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS 11+, Windows 10+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- **Computer Use**: macOS 13+ on x64/arm64, or Windows 10+ on x64; other supported DeepClaw platforms continue to work without this feature
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 1GB available disk space

### Installation

#### Pre-built Releases (Recommended)

Download the latest release for your platform from the [Releases](https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/ClawX/releases) page.

#### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ValueCell-ai/ClawX.git
cd DeepClaw

# Initialize the project
pnpm run init

# Start in development mode
pnpm dev
```

### First Launch

When you launch DeepClaw for the first time, the **Setup Wizard** will guide you through:

1. **Language & Region** - Configure your preferred locale
2. **AI Provider** - Add providers with API keys or OAuth for providers that support browser or device login
3. **Skill Bundles** - Select pre-configured skills for common use cases
4. **Verification** - Test your configuration before entering the main interface

The wizard preselects your system language when it is supported, and falls back to English otherwise.

### Local Computer Use

DeepClaw bundles CUA SDK and Driver **0.25.0**. On macOS and Windows, it disables CUA product telemetry with `CUA_DRIVER_RS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` in both Main's embedded daemon options and Gateway-launched CLI environments. The SDK allowlist supports this override since 0.22.0, superseding the 0.21.0 CLI-only workaround. This does not change system-wide environment variables, standalone CUA settings, or DeepClaw's own telemetry preference.

The Windows console-to-GUI PE patch remains in place alongside telemetry suppression: the pinned upstream source still uses `cmd /c ver` for telemetry and does not provide an automatic no-window fix. Earlier Windows user reports concern 0.21.0; rebuilt Windows 0.25.0 startup, CLI output, and flash behavior still require native validation. See [validation history and limits](harness/reference/computer-use-cli-validation.md).

Use a model and provider endpoint that support image input. Successful screenshot capture alone does not mean the model can see it. Provider synchronization fills missing input metadata for recognized vision models, while preserving explicit text-only declarations; unknown models remain text-only. If screenshots are reported as unsupported, check the selected provider/model rather than continuing blind keyboard input.

Computer Use is optional and **off by default**, including existing installations without an explicit preference. Enable **Developer Mode** in Settings to reveal **Computer Use** in the sidebar, then enable the feature on that page. The choice persists across restarts. Electron Main owns the embedded driver service and permissions; disabling stops that service and removes its private connection descriptor. No remote discovery or OpenClaw node pairing is involved.

Agents invoke the bundled native CUA CLI through OpenClaw's existing `exec` tool, then view screenshot files through its image-capable `read` tool. There is no DeepClaw `computer` tool, OpenClaw plugin, or MCP proxy in this path. The pinned CLI's full native capabilities are available on supported platforms, including windows, accessibility elements (AX), menus, browser/recording operations, and `verify_state`, rather than a DeepClaw-defined action subset. Primary-display screenshots, pointer, click, drag, scroll, text, key, and bounded wait operations remain available; individual commands still depend on platform, application, and OS permissions.

On macOS, the management page shows read-only **Accessibility** and **Screen Recording** statuses. Startup, activation, and enabling the toggle never request permissions. Enable the feature and explicitly choose **Request Permissions**. A request does not guarantee another system dialog: if access remains ungranted, the page now shows guidance instead of silently returning to the same state. Check System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility and Screen & System Audio Recording (Screen Recording on older macOS). Authorize the app actually listed: normally DeepClaw for the installed app, but a development launch may be attributed to its terminal or IDE, such as Ghostty or VS Code. Restart DeepClaw and, if needed, its launcher after changing grants. The screen-access check cannot distinguish never-requested access from a previous denial. Disabling Computer Use does not revoke OS grants. Missing permissions or driver files leave the driver unavailable without preventing Chat or Gateway startup.

The bundled **computer-use** Skill retains the `/computer-use` picker command and is based on the [official Skill accompanying CUA 0.25.0](https://github.com/trycua/cua/tree/45d78fedcf2c7033ba33f10dd30f8af8ba31ec3f/libs/cua-driver/rust/Skills/cua-driver), from tag `cua-driver-rs-v0.25.0`, commit `45d78fedcf2c7033ba33f10dd30f8af8ba31ec3f`, not upstream's moving `main`. Its MIT-licensed documents and license ship offline with a short DeepClaw-specific entrypoint for the Main-owned endpoint, permissions, sessions, and image handling.

**DeepClaw manages the entire `~/.openclaw/skills/computer-use` directory.** On every startup, any differing same-name installation is replaced with the current bundle, including user edits and extra files or directories; matching content is left untouched. Custom variants must use another Skill name and directory. Other-named Skills and settings, including the Computer Use enablement preference, remain unchanged. Replacement is staged with publication rollback; a same-name symlink is replaced without following or deleting its external target. This uses the current bundle comparison, not historical installation hashes, and does not change the official CUA 0.25.0 document bytes or provenance checks. Selecting the Skill neither enables the service nor grants OS permissions. See [Skill provenance and integration](harness/reference/computer-use-skill.md).

Screenshot files stay in a task-owned directory in the active local agent workspace, but reading them for model vision can send their contents to your model provider. Keep sensitive windows out of captures. Local execution, workspace access, and image-capable model/provider support are required; unsupported sandbox or remote contexts must report the limitation, not relax global shell approvals or start another driver. Skill guidance is not a shell sandbox or global action lock. Cancelling `exec` cannot undo an already admitted native action and is not a native emergency-stop guarantee. After a driver restart or unknown completion, rediscover the endpoint and observe before deciding what to do; do not blindly repeat input. Consequential or external actions require confirmation.

> Web search note: DeepClaw disables OpenClaw's general-purpose `web_search` tool at both the agent and Gateway policy layers. This includes Moonshot (Kimi) search; managed browser automation and `web_fetch` remain available.
>
> Internal tool note: DeepClaw also disables `gateway`, `nodes`, `create_goal`, `get_goal`, and `update_goal` for agents at both policy layers. Application-owned Gateway RPCs remain available, as do messaging, session orchestration, and agent discovery tools.

### Proxy Settings

DeepClaw includes built-in proxy settings for Electron, the OpenClaw Gateway, and channels such as Telegram that need to reach the internet through a local proxy client.

Open **Settings -> Gateway -> Proxy** to configure the default proxy, bypass rules, and optional developer-mode overrides for HTTP, HTTPS, and `ALL_PROXY` / SOCKS. A local example is `http://127.0.0.1:7890`.

> For proxy fallback behavior, Telegram synchronization, and **OpenClaw Doctor**, see [docs/en-US/proxy-settings.md](docs/en-US/proxy-settings.md).

## Architecture

DeepClaw uses a **dual-process architecture with a unified Host API layer**: the React renderer calls one client abstraction, while Electron Main owns protocol selection, Gateway lifecycle, and the ACP Chat stdio bridge.

- **Process model**: Electron Main owns the window, Gateway supervision, system integration, and updates; the OpenClaw Gateway provides AI orchestration, channel, and skill capabilities; the renderer does not access local endpoints directly.
- **Local Computer Use**: Electron Main retains `EmbeddedCuaDriverHost`, native SDK loading, permission checks, and daemon supervision. `DEEPCLAW_CUA_CONNECTION_FILE` identifies a private descriptor `{ v: 2, generation, driverVersion, binaryPath, socketPath }`. Existing OpenClaw `exec` invokes that absolute bundled binary with the explicit socket, and `read` supplies screenshot images to the model. No custom plugin, MCP proxy, node host, pairing, or runtime download is involved.
- **Configuration delivery**: Main uses `config.get`/`config.set` while the Gateway is running and updates the resolved JSON5 config while it is stopped or starting; ordinary provider, agent, skill, and model changes do not replace the process, and credentials are hot-reloaded through `secrets.reload`. After three minutes without verified Gateway activity, DeepClaw verifies the core RPC and restarts only an unavailable Gateway process it owns; externally managed Gateways are left for manual recovery.
- **ACP Chat**: Chat UI talks to OpenClaw via [ACP (Agent Client Protocol)](https://agentclientprotocol.com), providing a relatively stable chat protocol surface in front of the rapidly iterating OpenClaw. ACP runs through a Main-owned stdio bridge, supporting authenticated history replay after config reloads, streaming across navigation, and Main-validated media, attachments, and file activity. Files added through native drag-and-drop or the file picker are referenced at their canonical source paths without a DeepClaw staging copy; path-backed images remain ACP resource links instead of being rematerialized under OpenClaw's `media/inbound`, so later source changes, moves, or deletion affect the attachment. Clipboard and other pathless byte attachments still require protected temporary staging and inline image transport. Generated files confirmed by OpenClaw's internal-UI message-tool delivery, including Excel workbooks, are recovered as attachment cards when ACP omits the resource block. When a guarded Gateway restart interrupts an accepted turn, the patched OpenClaw runtime explicitly links its recovery run to the original ACP prompt so subsequent text and tool activity continue in the same in-memory turn; later history replay restores persisted tool boundaries as native ACP updates. If another restart loses terminal delivery after the final response is persisted, run- and session-scoped reconciliation settles the pending prompt instead of leaving Chat executing.
- **Design principles**: One frontend entry point, Main-owned transport, graceful recovery with reconnect/timeout/backoff, secure storage, and CORS-safe boundaries.

## CCWork accounts and CCWorkClaw

Claw account login and registration connect to **https://ccwork.site**. Open the
sidebar account entry to sign in. Verification-code login is the default: enter an
email or mainland China phone number, request a code, and submit it. ccwork
registers an identifier it has not seen before, so the same form works for new and
existing accounts and no password is needed. Password login and explicit
registration (verification code plus a password) are one click away in the same
dialog. A custom ccwork HTTPS origin or local HTTP server can be entered there too.
Self-signup policy and password validation come from ccwork. Passwords are not
saved. JWT sessions stay in Electron Main and are encrypted with the operating
system; when encryption is unavailable they last only for the current app run.

Signing in enables every routable chat model in your personal ccwork catalog — there
is no per-model opt-in step. The catalog uses ccwork model UUIDs and preserves
server context/output limits and vision/reasoning capabilities. Account model calls,
tools, streaming responses, and model tests pass through the ccwork billed proxy.
Tests consume credits. The account's default and fallback chain and the chat model
selector use ccwork, and the Models page lists the enabled models so you can switch
which one is primary. Credit balance and consumption on the Usage page come from the personal
ccwork organization. Local Token history is diagnostic and does not determine
wallet charges. The account menu opens an in-app recharge dialog with credit packages and
Alipay or WeChat QR payment; after payment confirmation it refreshes the balance automatically.
Closing the dialog keeps an unpaid order available to continue later. Log out to revoke local
access and remove the account provider.

The added `ccworkclaw` brand has its own app ID, executable, data directory
(`.ccworkclaw`), provider key, and CCWork icons.

The brand logo is copied from the ccwork project's root `logo.png` into
`brands/ccworklogo.png`. Updates use ccwork's `huanxingupdate` Aliyun OSS bucket
at `https://huanxingupdate.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/desktop-updates/ccworkclaw`.
The updater appends the release channel; Windows stable packages and `latest.yml`
belong in `ccworkclaw/latest/`. This directory is separate from ccwork desktop
releases. Upload the CCWorkClaw installer, manifest, and blockmap together.

Build on PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:BRAND = 'ccworkclaw'
corepack pnpm run build:vite
corepack pnpm run package:win
```

The existing default brand remains HuanxingClaw. This source integration does not
publish installers or provision the CCWorkClaw update feed.
